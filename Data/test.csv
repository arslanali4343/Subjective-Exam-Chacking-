39,Will leaving corpses lying around upset my prisoners?,"I see questions/information online about how to get rid of corpses but I'm not sure what the consequences to having them lying around are.

I know that I can use a morgue to store them and that they will eventually be taken away in a hearse. However, I've always just left them lying around. This doesn't seem to have any obvious consequences.

Do they upset prisoners or staff (e.g. increasing the danger level beyond what death normally does)? Make them sick? Slow down pathing? Is this something that's not implemented yet or is leaving dead bodies all over the place meant to be completely fine?

The wiki's pages for Death and Morgue don't shed any light on this. All I'm finding is the how of getting rid of corpses/glitches related to it but not why it matters in the first place. All I've seen that's related is that apparently prisoners can loot guard corpses for keys, but there's no obvious consequences for prisoner corpses which are what I tend to end up with.

So why not just leave them in the corridors?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
",Anu,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/72927,"I think it is possible with custom fields.

Add a custom fields, for example, named link. Put the link into the value field. Then you will be able to access it something like that:

&lt;a href=""&lt;?php echo get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'link', true ); ?&gt;""&gt;
    &lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt;

70,"Is accuracy, recoil or bullet spread affected by enemy hits?","To experiment I started a bot game, toggled invincibility and let the bots attack me. There were two clear hit effects: a major one that tilts view up a lot and sideways and a minor one that only tilts it up.

So I tried releasing single shots exactly at the tilts: during a major one a single bullet ended up here (slightly covered by text). Actually the crosshair never moves that high so there tends to be a good amount of additional upward deviation of single shots fired.

But when single-shooting during the minor tilts the marks seemed to end up exactly at the location of the crosshair.

Now, when switching to spraying while being shot this pattern emerged. This was mostly caused by the minor tilts and, I guess, ""standard recoil"". Occasionally a major tilt caused a single bullet to lie severly outside of the depicted cone.

132,Suddenly got an I/O error from my external HDD,"I have used my Raspberry Pi as a torrent-server for quite a while now. My Western Digital ""My Passport-Ultra"" external HDD and Transmission running on RPi has worked flawlessly for more than a year. Suddenly last week my setup started producing I/O errors and now when I SSH into my RPi I cant find the HDD folder. 

I have not changed anything with my RPi or the torrent-server setup since I set it up.

Can someone help me find a solution to my problem?

EDIT:

The external HHD works fine the first 20 minutes or so, and then Transmisson gives me ""Error: Input/output error"".

I recommend that you copy all of your data off of this drive to another hard drive before it fails completely. 

It is possible that it could be the USB connection on the Pi instead of the drive.  Does the drive behave like this on a different computer system?

Again, I strongly recommend that you backup any irreplaceable data on this drive before it fails completely.  If you have another USB drive I recommend using rsync.  I use the following command to backup one external hard drive to a 2nd device on my Pi where /media/USBHDD1 is the mount point of the 1st drive and /media/USBHDD2 is the mount point of the 2nd drive.  rsync can recover from an interrupted copy in case your drive disappears while performing the copy.  You should be able to just power cycle failed drive and perform the copy command again.  rsync should pick up where it left off.

rsync -av --delete /media/USBHDD1/* /media/USBHDD2/

257,Configure which plugin custom post types get registered,"I am writing a plugin that creates custom post types, but i want users to be able to turn them on and off via a filter in the functions.php file.

The issue i'm having is that custom post types register_post_type has to be called during init and functions.php is read far after this.

How can I allow users to provide an array using a filter or action that will control which post types register_post_type gets called?

// currently the custom post type constructor has this
if(!post_type_exists($this-&gt;name)) {
  add_action(""init"", array($this, ""register_post_type""));

  The issue i'm having is that custom post types register_post_type has
  to be called during init and functions.php is read far after this.


That's not true. functions.php is read before init because you can declare your functions in there and then hook them to init.

Since you want to avoid a settings page and you want your users to modify the code (at your own risk), you could use some flags:

add_action('init', 'wpse_109719_post_types');

function wpse_109719_post_types(){

  $post_type1 = true;
  $post_type2 = true;
  $post_type3 = false; // your users don't want this one

  if( $post_type1 ){
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_1', $args );
  }

  if( $post_type2 ){
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_2', $args );
  }

  if( $post_type3 ){
    // won't be registered since $post_type3 was declared as false
    register_post_type( 'your_post_type_3', $args );
  }

}



Not tested, but you can use something like that to collect the post types:

$val = array ();
$options_array = apply_filters( 'my_unique_filter', $val );
print_r( $options_array );
// make a loop and register_post_type here. don't forget to hook at init


In your plugins:

function filter1( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type1';
  return $val;
}

function filter2( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type2';
  return $val;
}

function filter3( $val ){
  $val[] = 'post_type3';
  return $val;
}


add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter1');
add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter2');
add_filter('my_unique_filter', 'filter3');

267,"Why say ""it rhymes with Grape""?","There is a scene in 21 Jumpstreet where Dave Franco' character Eric says ""do you know what they'll do to me in prison it rhymes with grape"" and it made me curious as to why it was phrased that way. 

In Knocked Up a similar joke was made ""it rhymes with smabortion"" which I believe I read was done due to censors. However the repeating setup for the joke has me curious if this time it was due to censors or if it was just considered a funny setup that bared repeating. So was it censoring or continuing a joke?
",Kevin Howell,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/645,"Opinion: It was a funny(?) joke.

Although a similar setup was used in Knocked Up, the truth is similar setups have been used in plenty of comedy movies.

Whilst I understand your query regarding the censors, it seems difficult to imagine why censorship would be an issue, the main reason I can think of being:


There is a colossal amount of crass language, violence, partial nudity and drug taking in the film. Why would all this be considered acceptable but a line about rape wouldn't be?


It seems more likely to me that it was a funny line that works in the context of the scene as it seems so abhorrent that he can't bring himself to utter the actual word, instead resorting to childish rhyming (suggesting the mere thought of it makes him regress to his inner child in fear). 

Whether it was a homage to his (extremely popular) line from Knocked Up is something I can find no reference to online, but solely in my own opinion, I can't see how this was a censorship issue.

/** Grab the terms within the for the 'portfolio_cat' taxonomy for the current post */

322,How to add custom fields to menu items,"I've been looking at using menu attributes module for Drupal 7 to add an extra field to the menu navigation system. However this adds a new attribute to the attribute array and thus prints it out in the anchor link.

e.g.

  function themename_menu_link(array $variables) {
  $element = $variables['element'];
  $sub_menu = '';

  if ($element['#below'])
  {
    $sub_menu = drupal_render($element['#below']);
  }

  $element['#localized_options']['html'] = TRUE;

  $subtitle = $element['#localized_options']['attributes']['subtitle']; //get sub text

  $linktext = $element['#title']. '&lt;span&gt;'. $subtitle .'&lt;/span&gt;';
  $output = l($linktext, $element['#href'], $element['#localized_options']);
  return '&lt;li' . drupal_attributes($element['#attributes']) . '&gt;' . $output . $sub_menu . ""&lt;/li&gt;\n"";
}

&lt;a subtitle=""subtitleexampletext"" href=""/node/13""&gt;About us&lt;span&gt;subtitleexampletext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


is there anyway to hide the attribute in the link and just spit it out where ever I want it in the html? Or is there a better way of doing this? I've looked at power menu module as well, but thats not quite what I'm after either.

TIA
",Jared,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/10963,"You can use hook_form_alter to alter the menu link edit form. 
This way you can add a extra field to the form, in your case:

$form['subtitle'] = array(
 '#type'=&gt;'textfield',
 '#title'=&gt; t('Subtitle'),
);


Then add an extra submit hanlder to the form:

$form['#submit'][] = '_my_submit_handler';


In your submit handler you can access your custom value by using $form_state['values']['subtitle'].

340,A BrainF*ck-ish compiler in C,"-ish because I removed the input functionality from the compiler. And, the compiler does not support nested loops

I've been recently reading up on compilers and how they work.

Although this doesn't use most of the things I've learned about (the lexical and parser things), I thought it would be fun to try create a brainf*ck compiler, rather than an interpreter.

Code

bfc.c

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static int i;
static char *code; // these two as static so get_amt_to_change can easily interact

int get_amt_to_change(char c); // so the compiler doesn't write (ie) add di, 1 ten times

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    code = argv[1];
    puts(""xor di, di\n""
         ""setup_loop:\n""
         ""mov byte [tape + di], 0\n""
         ""add di, 1\n""
         ""cmp di, 101\n""
         ""jne setup_loop\n""
         ""xor di, di""); // sets up the tape with all 0's
    int loop_count = 0; // to keep track of asm subroutines for [ and ]
    for(i = 0; code[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        switch(code[i]) {
            case '+':
                printf(""add byte [tape + di], %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('+'));
                break;
            case '-':
                printf(""sub byte [tape + di], %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('-'));
                break;
            case '&gt;':
                printf(""add di, %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('&gt;'));
                break;
            case '&lt;':
                printf(""sub di, %d\n"", get_amt_to_change('&lt;'));
                break;

                       ""end_loop%d:\n"", loop_count, loop_count);

    i--; // if it wasn't == c, then go back one character and find out what it was equal to in the next call

Questions


My C code only has one subroutine. Are there any other logical ones to add?
I did a lot of optimizing on the assembly code output. Could it be further optimized?

You can optimize the setup code by iterating backwards. It shaves off 2 instructions! It too will leave DI=0.

357,The Riemann Integrability of a function similar to Dirichlet's function,"$\textbf{Problem:}$ Consider the function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by letting $f(x)=0$ for rational $x$ and $f(x)=x$ for irrational $x$. Calculate the upper and lower Riemann integrals of $f$. Is $f$ Riemann integrable?  

$\textbf{	Solution Attempt:}$ Let $P_n=\{0=t_0,...,t_n=1\}$ be a partition of $[0,1]$, where $t_k = \frac{k}{n}$. For this partition, we have $$U(f,P_n)=\sum^{n}_{k=1} t_k (t_k - t_{k-1}) = \sum^{n}_{k=1} t_k (\frac{k}{n} - \frac{k-1}{n})=\sum^{n}_{k=1} \frac{k}{n} (\frac{1}{n})= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum^{n}_{k=1} k.$$ A familiar property of the natural numbers gives us that $\sum^{n}_{k=1} k= \frac{1}{2}n(n+1).$ Thus, $U(f,P)= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2n}.$ Recall, the upper Riemann integral $U(f)$ is defined as $U(f)=\inf
\{U(f,P)\}$, where $P$ is a parition of $[0,1].$ As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $P_n \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}.$ [Note: this is where I am a little unsure of myself.] Thus, $U(f)=\frac{1}{2}$. However, the lower Riemann integral is $0$. Hence, the upper and lower Riemann integrals disagree. We conclude that $f$ is not Riemann integrable. $\blacksquare$

If the aforementioned function was changed so that it took on the value of $0$ for irrational $x$ and $x$ for rational $x$, then $f$ would be zero almost-everywhere. Hence, it would be Lebesgue integrable. Is this correct? I am quite unsure of the Lebesgue integrability for the original function. A hint would great! Thank you!

This works for most tables, but not for all. If a table never had any data, the current identity value is NULL instead of 0:

542,Surfaces ruled over elliptic curves,"Ground field $\Bbb{C}$. Algebraic category. Elliptic surfaces are those surfaces endowed with a morphism onto some smooth curve, with generic fiber an elliptic curve.

Suppose $E$ is an elliptic curve and consider the ruled surface
$$ S=\frac{E\times\Bbb{P}^1}{G} $$
where $G$ is a group of translations of $E$, acting on $\Bbb{P}^1$. Then $S$ is an elliptic surface, for the projection on the second factor induces a morphism $S\rightarrow\Bbb{P}^1$ whose fibers are elliptic curves ($F=E/G$, in fact).

Now, let $p\colon S\rightarrow C$ be an elliptic surface and suppose $S$ is ruled over an elliptic curve $E$. 

Is $S$ isomorphic to the above example? Any hint for attacking this? Thank you.
",Heitor,https://mathoverflow.net/users/34136,"EDIT We show that the answer to the OP's question is yes. Thanks to Will Sawin for his comments.

I use the notation of [Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, Chapter V Section 2].

Since $S$ is a ruled surface, there exists a section $C_0$ of minimal self-intersection; set $C_0^2 = -e$. If we write $S=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, with $\mathcal{E}$ normalized, then $e= - \deg \mathcal{E}$.

Moreover, since the base of the ruling is an elliptic curve $E$, then $e \in \{-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \}$.

We can exclude the case $e &gt;0$. Indeed, any divisor $D \in \textrm{Pic}(S)$ can be written as $a C_0 + b f$, where $f$ is the fibre of the ruling. Now the elliptic fibre of the morphism over $\mathbb{P}^1$ must satisfy  $(aC_0+bf)^2=0$, that is $b = \frac{1}{2}ae$. But if $e &gt;0$ then an effective divisor must also satisfy $b \geq ae$ (Hartshorne, Proposition 2.20 p. 382) and this is a contradiction.

Then the only possibility is $e \in \{-1, 0 \}$.

The case $e=-1$ corresponds to the second symmetric product $\textrm{Sym}^2(E)$; in this case $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposable rank two vector bundle on $E$ with $\deg \mathcal{E} =1$. Then the linear system $|4C_0-2f|$ is a pencil of elliptic curves. One can also write $S$ in the desired for (see Wil Sawin's first comment). 

The case $\mathcal{E}=0$ corresponds either to the trivial bundle (so $S$ is a product), or to $\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, with $\deg \mathcal{L}=0$ or to $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposible rank two vector bundle on $E$ such that $\deg \mathcal{E}=0$.

Let us consider first the case $\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, with $\deg \mathcal{L}=0$. Then the curves in the elliptic pencil should correspond to elements of $h^0(aC_0)$, that is to sections of $\textrm{Sym}^a (\mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L})$. Since we must have two independent sections, we obtain that  $\mathcal{L}$ is a torsion bundle. In this case the elliptic fibration do exist, and one can easily write $S$ in the desired form (see Will Sawin's second comment).

Finally, let us exclude the case $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, with $\mathcal{E}$ indecomposable of degree $0$. Again, the curves in the elliptic pencil must correspond to elements of $h^0(aC_0)$, that is to sections of $\textrm{Sym}^a \mathcal{E}$. But from [Atiyah, Vector bundles on an elliptic curve, Theorem 9] one sees that $\textrm{Sym}^a  \mathcal{E}$ is again indecomposable of degree $0$, and that $h^0(\textrm{Sym}^a \mathcal{E})=1$. Thus one does not have two independent sections, and the elliptic pencil cannot exist.

Summing up, we obtain


  Let $p \colon S \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be an elliptic surface and assume that $S$ is ruled over an elliptic curve $E$. Then $S=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, where either 
  
  $\bullet$ $\mathcal{E}$ is the unique indecomposable rank $2$ vector bundle of degree $1$ on $E$, or
  
  $\bullet$ $\mathcal{E}= \mathcal{O}_E \oplus \mathcal{L}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a (possibly trivial) torsion line bundle. 
  
  In both cases, we can also write $S$ in the desired form $S=(E \times \mathbb{P}^1)/G$.

After a long consulation with a generous user from GRASS community, I still havn't came to a solution. I've tried on two computers with WIN 7 as operation system, the following GRASS versions: 6.4.2 (through QGIS and without the plugin), 6.4.3 RCs, 7.0.0

For the first two I have received the same error, for version 7 I didn't recieve the error but the process have never finished. On the other hand, my helper managed to complete it in seconds using my files.

Can the problem have something to do with windows 7, some background or system process, or so? Should I install any extention or plugin in order to run network analysis programs on win 7?

589,Bash filename tab completion,"I have noticed sometimes that tab completion is helpfully filtered in bash. I am a java programmer and often use the java and javac commands in the terminal for quick or remote tasks.

Say I have the two usual files in a directory: MyProgram.java and MyProgram.class

If I ask bash to tabcomplete from the command prefix java M, it fills straight out to java MyProgram, this is helpful. Clearly either bash is configured to only accept *.class completions for the java command (and knows to strip the file extension), or the java command is telling bash this somehow.

I would like to accomplish the same with a text editor, so I could type in nano M and have it tab complete to nano MyProgram.java rather than pausing at nano MyProgram., is it possible to say, blacklist *.class from nano's tab complete?

Most of all I'd just be interested to know if this is a bash configuration or something program-side.
",lynks,https://superuser.com/users/155196,"java has a separate auto-completion script that overrides the default completion mechanism. On my distribution (Arch Linux), it is installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/java.

To override the behaviour of tab-completion, you could create such a script. If you just want to have all .class files ignored for every command, you could set the FIGNORE variable (e.g. in your ~/.bashrc). Example: FIGNORE=.class. From the manual page of bash:


  FIGNORE
  A  colon-separated  list  of  suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from the list of matched filenames.  A sample value is "".o:~"".

Ovbiously I'm making the assumption that your $page_template variable doesn't have .php on the end, but you can ammend that as required.

I'd recommend you have a read of the documentation related to this hook, and the locate_template function -

While most well-known Lie groups are matrix groups, there do in fact exist Lie groups which are not matrix groups. That is, they have no faithful finite dimensional representations.

For example, let $H$ be the real Heisenberg group

$$H=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; a &amp; b\newline 0&amp;1&amp;c\newline 0 &amp;0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\mid a,b,c\in\mathbb{R} \},$$

$$\Gamma=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; n\newline0&amp;1&amp;0\newline 0 &amp;0 &amp;1\end{pmatrix}\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$$

The subgroup $\Gamma$ is central, and thus normal. The Lie group $H/\Gamma$ has no faithful finite dimensional representations over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

First look at the picture:



Since Madara came, he was using only Sharingan, and this can be seen until 07:43 in the picture, while he was dodging Gaara's sand attacks. However, when Naruto was above him with an Odama Rasengan, Madara suddenly could be seen with the Rinnegan on his eyes (07:45), and nobody noticed it like if it was a mistake. It should have been normal Sharingan.

Then, at 08:17, Madara was using the Mangekyou Sharingan, since he activated it after Naruto's attack to invoke the Susanoo.

And after that, at around 10:04, Madara was targeted by a Rasenshuriken, hence he had to activate the Rinnegan, and that was at 10:06. It was the first time that he did it since he came to life with Edo Tensei, and that could be confirmed from everybody's reaction when they saw his Rinnegan at around 10:56 (""Why does he have the Rinnegan?"").

Was it a mistake that they drew Madara with the Rinnegan at 07:45?

740,"Who and why sent the box in the episode ""The Boy in the Box""?","In the TV show ""Cold Case"", the investigation in the episode ""The Boy in the Box"" (2004) was initiated by someone leaving the box of memories of the murdered boy on the steps of St. Emilian's Church. Among them was a picture of the never-before-identified victim, with the note ""His name was Arnold"".

My question is: who sent that box, and why then?

My best guess is that it was somehow related to that boy's mother's death (who happened to have ""died recently"", as sister Vivian said), but I fail to see how. Is there some hint to the answer that I've missed? They usually explain that kind of stuff.
",Vedran Šego,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/5589,"We don't know, but probably someone under the instructions of Sister Grace.

We do know from the episode that the body was discovered by a man called Walter Rafferty. Every year, he revisited the spot where he found the body. We also find out that he's not the only visitor. Every year, a woman in a green coat brings a rose to the location.

As the episode progresses, we learn that this woman is Sister Grace. We also learn that Sister Grace is the mother of Arnold (the boy in the box), conceived with a man called Clayton. Arnold instinctively seemed to know this, as he wanted to remain with the sisters as opposed to getting adopted.

Despite this, Sister Grace is eager for him to move on. She is concerned about his behaviour and basically convinces Clayton to give him one of the treatments being done in his work. These treatments are radiation related and should not be used on Arnold. Sister Grace, however, is hopeful they will work. Alas, they do not - Arnold dies soon after and the Sisters put the body in the box.

So we know this then:


Sister Grace was really Arnold's mother.   
Sister Grace desperately wanted Arnold to be adopted, inadvertantly causing his death through the radiation treatment.   
Sister Grace visited the place his body was found every year.


This strongly suggests that the suitcase given to the police, shortly after her death, notifying them about the case, was related to her. Whether her will stipulated it be delivered, or a friend did it, we don't know. It just seems very likely she is the root cause of it.

Ultimately though, the mystery works in this episode. The Boy in the Box is based on a real life, unsolved murder. Whilst they effectively discover what happened in this episode, who alerted them remains a mystery. This ties in well with the fact that the case's real life counterpart is unsolved and thus a mystery as well.

765,"Why is ""in the name of Jesus Christ"" usually used at the end?","In the scriptures, a phrase such as ""in the name of the Lord"" or ""in the name of Jesus"" is typically used at the beginning of statements, especially commands. In our day, I notice that most of our prayers, for instance, end ""in Jesus' name"" or ""in the name of Jesus Christ."" By way of another example, it seems that even most special Priesthood blessings by Latter-day Saints end with such a phrase, instead of starting with it.

Is there significance in the reversal of the placement of this phrase? Does the meaning change whether at the beginning or end?

(Sometimes I think when we say a prayer and end it with that phrase, it tends to get lost behind the other words, or is said quickly as a part of just ending the prayer, instead of carrying the meaning of praying in the Lord's name, which is why I'm asking this question.)
",Matt,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/1003,"The answer to your question is in several Scriptures. 

In the book of Matthew He told us first of all that we should pray directly to the Father, and not for rewards here on Earth.

Matthew 6:5 through 7 KJV


  5  And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
  
  6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
  
  7  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.


Then Jesus taught his disciples (which of course includes us) in the model prayer:

Matthew 6:9 through 15 KJV


  9  After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. 
  
  10  Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
  
  11  Give us this day our daily bread. 
  
  12  And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 
  
  13  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
  
  14  For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 
  
  15  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.


This was given as an outline and not meant to be recited word for word, but even if you recite it word for word, what matters is your intent; and so praying the ""Lord's Prayer"" in not in any way sacrilegious as long as your intent is right.

He went on to say that we need to pray knowing that God has the power to grant our every wish, and that He will grant them in accordance with His plans for us.

Matthew 21:22  KJV


  And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. 


John 14:13 and 14 KJV


  13  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
  
  14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.


Finally He tells us that if we expect him to grant our request we must continue in his word, and be the best Christian we know how to be.

John 15:7  KJV 


  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

811,Why do Apple bloggers use Skype or Google Hangouts instead of iChat for video podcasts?,"I enjoy a few ""talking heads"" type of video podcasts by Apple bloggers. How come they don't use iChat? Doesn't iChat have group video conferencing or are there technical (as opposed to social) reasons to prefer skype over iChat for producing a video podcast?
",thanks_in_advance,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/60784,"
Awareness

Many people know what Skype is — not many know about iChat in comparison. As soon as someone says 'video conference' the immediate response by many is 'Skype!'
Familiarity

Many of the older video podcasts use Skype because that's what they started with. Familiarity is very important with people that make video podcasts for a living. They see no reason to switch because Skype works well for them.
Plugins

There are a number of plugins made for Skype for recording the call, etc. This means that for those that use Skype they'd have no reason to switch to iChat since their favourite plugin isn't available that works with the rest of their equipment.
Livestreaming

Many video podcasts use Google Hangouts because of its ease of use for livestreaming it as well. Google Hangouts can be livestreamed with practically no preparation or equipment and then immediately made available on YouTube after, which is perfect for many.
Number of People

Google Hangouts can hold many more people than iChat/Skype, which makes it perfect for large events.

851,Linear Independence of a set of Complex Vectors,"I am trying to understand how to determine the linear dependence/independence of a set of complex vectors.  I know the process is the same as determining linear dependence/independence of a set of real vectors, but I am a little confused on how to augment the sets of vectors.  For instance if I have
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 + i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 - i \end{bmatrix}

Could you please tell me is there any way to tell gfortran to look up that folder for necessary .o files?
I've tried -I and -L options, but no way. When I write .o names directly, it works:gfortran main.for ./library/obj1.o ./library/obj2.o but I have many of .o files and write all of them waste time.

I hoped that something like gfortran main.for -L./library/ will work, but it doesn't.

And I'm pretty sure that I should use makefile for such case
",iMisanthrope,https://stackoverflow.com/users/3414386,"You are confusing object files with static libraries. An object file
is not a static library and the gfortran linker - which is simply
the GNU system linker, invoked by gfortran - will not treat it as such.
You need a static library and you are trying to use object files in lieu. 

The linker recognizes an object file by the extension .o. It recognizes
a static library by the extension .a, and it expects the contents of an .a file
to have the form of a static library, not the format of an object file. (So you
cannot make an object file into a static library just by renaming it).

The linker will link into your program every object file that appears on its
commandline, whether or not it is needed. It does not expect you to mention
object files if you don't want them linked. The linker options -L and -l for
locating libraries have no application to object files.

A static library is a fairly simple archive containing some number of
object files, plus a house-keeping header and typically an index of the
public symbols defined in the contained object files.

When the linker encounters a static library on its commandline, it does not
link the entire contents of the library (unless you expressly tell it to). It inspects
the contained object files to determine which, if any, of them contain
definitions for symbols that are as yet undefined at that point in the linkage
of the program. If any object file in the library is found to provide any
of the missing definitions, then that object file is extracted from the library
and linked into the program. Object files in the library that provide no
missing definitions are not linked. Libraries on the commandline are sequentially
inspected in this way until either all the symbols referred to by the program 
have definitions in linked object files or there are no more libraries.

If as you say the object files that you are trying to use as libraries are stable
resources that you never have to build for your projects, then you can just make a static
library out of them and link that library with your per-project programs.

To make a static library from object files, use the ar tool. 
See man ar.

When you have made your library, say, libsubs.a, and have decided it shall reside
in some directory, /path/to/subs, then you link it with a program by adding

    -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


to the commandline in which your program is linked. This will cause the linker
to search for a library called libsubs.a in directory /path/to/subs.

So if you are compiling and linking in a single step, use it like:

gfortran -o myprog myprog.f90 -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


And if you are compiling and linking in distinct steps, use it like:

gfortran -c -o myprog_1st_file.o myprog_1st_file.f90
gfortran -c -o myprog_2nd_file.o myprog_2nd_file.f90
gfortran -o myprog myprog_1st_file.o myprog_2nd_file.o -L/path/to/subs -lsubs


This is how you are supposed to use a set of object file resources of which
different subsets will be required for linkage with different programs: you put
them in a library and link the library.

  (1) The man from whom I got the pen.
  
  (2) The man from I got the pen.
  
  (3) The man I got the pen from.
  
  (4) The man who(m) I got the pen from.  


Let's start with example (4) because it's the easiest to talk about:


(4) .... the man(i) [whom (i)  I got the pen from ___ (i) ]


The man here is the antecedent for the word who(m).  There is a gap at the end of the clause that represents a missing word after the preposition from. All three parts have the same index, they all refer to the same person. We could represent the relative clause like this:


the man [whom I got the pen from him  ].


Here, the object of the preposition is the word who(m), but whom is at the beginning of the clause. The proposition from has been 'stranded' at the end of the sentence.

If we want to, we can put the whole preposition phrase at the beginning of the clause. This is what happens in example (1):


(1)  ... the man [from whom I got the pen ___ ]. 


If we arrange the sentence like this, the preposition occurs in the normal position before its object whom. We can think about the clause like this:


... the man [from whom I got the pen from him ]. 


Notice that we can only move the preposition so that it comes before its object. Otherwise it must stay in its normal position. In these relative clauses, I is the subject of the clause. Because the relative word who(m) is not the subject, we can drop it. We don't need to use a relative word at all:


(3) ... the man(i) [I got the pen from ____(i) ].


There is still a gap at the end of the sentence, where the object of from is missing. But there is no relative pronoun whom in this sentence. Notice that from must be at the end of the clause in its normal position. We cannot move it so that it comes before its object. This is because the object of the word from is missing! From here occurs before the gap where its object would be. We could represent the clause like this:


(3) ... the man [I got the pen from  him  ].


If we try to move from to  a different position, the clause will be ungrammatical:


(2) *... the man(i) [from I got the pen ___(i) ] (wrong).


Here the word from doesn't appear before its real object - or the gap left from the missing object. If we try to reconstruct the missing parts we have the following representation:


(2) *... the man [from I got the pen him ] (wrong).


This is definitely not a good clause!

Hope this is helpful.

905,Extend Wordpress (4.x) session and nonce,"We've got a small web application that allows users to log in (via WordPress) and remain logged in for a max 15 min session for security purposes. Because most sessions will last longer, I have a small ajax call that's made on each click of the html document itself. 

The ajax call itself fires to the /admin-ajax.php file, and it hits a function (in functions.php). Below is that function: 

function extend_my_session_yo(){
    $user_id = get_current_user_id();
    wp_set_auth_cookie($user_id, false, true);

    $new_logout = wp_logout_url();

    if ( is_user_logged_in() ) {
        echo 'session extended 15 mins ' . $new_logout;
    } 
    // if a user is *not* logged in, Wordpress just outputs a ""0"". 
    die();
}


The wp_set_auth_cookie() does the hard work. It correctly allows for (on each click) an extended 15 mins session. The problem is if someone tries to logout. The current logout link is echo'd via wp_logout_url(), but that logout url has a nonce from the moment it's created by WordPress. 

So in the function above, I'm generating a new logout url (and from the WP core code it seems that this is generated by getting the session token from the new cookie), but each click of the new logout url gives the Wordpress Failure Notice page indicating a nonce mismatch. I've even gone so far to copy code from pluggable.php (for wp_verify_nonce()) for checking the hash_equals() function for $expected vs $nonce and they're equal. Yet I still get nonce errors. 

Does anyone know how to set a new auth/logged_in cookie while also setting a new nonce to avoid these errors? 
",Focus97,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/68206,"Your problem is that you call wp_logout_url immediately after wp_set_auth_cookie. 

wp_set_auth_cookie() does some setcookie() calls. Unfortunately setcookie doesn't make the new value available instantly in the PHP global $_COOKIE. It must be set through a new HTTP Request first.

wp_logout_url() (via wp_nonce_url > wp_create_nonce > wp_get_session_token > wp_parse_auth_cookie) fetches $_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE] in order to create a valid nonce, not knowing that the logged in cookie has already been updated. (I'm not quite sure if we may call this a WP core bug.)

There is an action hook in wp_set_auth_cookie named set_logged_in_cookie, which should allow you to update the session cookie value during your ajax request. 

function my_update_cookie( $logged_in_cookie ){
    $_COOKIE[LOGGED_IN_COOKIE] = $logged_in_cookie;
}
add_action( 'set_logged_in_cookie', 'my_update_cookie' );

938,Concerns with washer and dryer in walk in closet,"We are looking to do a remodel and move the washer and dyer into a walk in closet. I am curious of any concerns or issues regarding having a washer and dryer inside a walk in closet. Mainly, in terms of moisture. Does the washer or dryer product enough moisture in the room that we would need to include a vent? Also, does the drywall in the room need to be the same that is used in bathrooms?

Update: Clarification. 
By vent, I mean a separate vent other than the dryer vent. Something like a bathroom ceiling vent in addition to the dryer exhaust vent.
",Kalel Wade,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/20953,"All dryers need a vent. Gas and electric dryers need a vent to the outside of the house to allow all the moisture to escape from the dryer. 

All-in-one washer/dryer combo units don't need an air vent, but need a water drain to remove the water from the drying stage (which you need anyways to drain the wash cycle). 

The walls are irrelevant. So don't worry about those.

The bigger concern would be the floor. If this is a high efficiency front-loading washer, it will be prone to lots of lateral shaking. Most wood framed floors are ill equipped to handle the speed of front loader washers. It's usually recommended that they be placed on concrete slabs. 

As such if the closet wasn't designed for a washer/dryer, then you probably need to beef up the floor as much as you can to reduce the shaking.

1082,PCB's and designing power connections,"I've designed a few PCB's now, but never put much thought into good practices. They were small boards and most of the emphasis was put into just making sure everything that needed to be connected was connected.

Now I want to get more serious into making well designed boards. I've designed and redesigned my current project multiple times trying to come up with a good looking layout. 

This project is based around the ATXMega256 mCU running on a 16Mhz crystal, around 60 total components and 7 or 8 of them being IC's.

For my next redesign, I plan on giving ""Manhattan Routing"" a go to at least try and help with crazy traces going every which way - but that's a little bit off topic.

The problem I seem to run into the most is understanding an appropriate method of running power to each IC. Normally, I would just daisy chain them but that is said to be a bad practice.

Here are my questions relating to feeding power


I've heard of the ""Star Configuration"" where all the IC's tie directly into the regulator but haven't seen a real life example of that so I'm not sure how to design that into my projects. It sounds like a mess of traces coming off of one pad in my mind. Can you post an example of a well designed Star Configuration?
What would be some advantages and disadvantages of using the star configuration as opposed to a power plane, other than the obvious of power being everywhere with a plane.
When is it ok or not ok to use a plane for VCC, specifically for a 2 layer board as I've heard that it's not as common on a 2 layer board?
If I shouldn't use a power plane, which is better in the case of traces needing to cross each other: using via's for GPIO or via's for power?
If it is ok to use a power plane on a 2 layer board, should VCC be on the top layer or bottom, obviously I would have a Ground plane as well.


I know there isn't a win/win answer to these questions because every project is going to be different and require different planning, but I think the basic concept behind it should be somewhat universal that people follow. You have to know the rules before you can break them.

I also realize that these questions may be beyond the scope of online discussion, but I'm looking for more general answers that can help push me in the right direction.

1153,Adding/multiplying summations of different indices to prove Cauchy-Schwarz,"$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_ib_j-a_jb_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j^2 +
\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i^2 \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_j^2 - 2\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ib_i \sum_{j=1}^{n}b_ja_j$

Can someone walk me through this. The different summation indices is throwing me off. 
The cauchy-schwarz inequality is generally written as

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_1b_1 \le (\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2)^{1/2}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i^2)^{1/2}$

So I'm not 100% sure what the elements $b_j$ and $a_j$ are.
",user101104,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/101104,"Hint: start off by expanding the square:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_ib_j-a_jb_i)^2
  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_i^2b_j^2-2a_ib_ja_jb_i+a_j^2b_i^2)$$
Now split the sum:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(a_ib_j-a_jb_i)^2
  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_i^2b_j^2
    -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}2a_ib_ja_jb_i
    +\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_j^2b_i^2\ .$$
The reason this RHS equals the previous RHS is that you are adding up the same things, only in a different order.  Now for the first sum, think about what happens when $j$ varies from $1$ to $n$.  As this happens, the $a_i^2$ never changes, so it is a constant factor and can be taken out of the sum:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_i^2b_j^2
  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_i^2b_j^2\Bigr)
  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j^2\Bigr)\ .$$
And now the sum over $j$ adds up to a fixed quantity which does not depend on $i$, so it can be taken outside the sum over $i$ to give
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_i^2b_j^2
  =\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^2\Bigr)\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j^2\Bigr)\ .$$

The last two steps are really just the same as
$$\sum_{j=1}^3ab_j=ab_1+ab_2+ab_3=a(b_1+b_2+b_3)=a\sum_{j=1}^3b_j\ .$$

Hopefully you can now treat the rest of the original expression in the same way.  Good luck!

1226,What is the best way to indicate when fields are empty in read-only mode?,"I am working with a data-intensive application that displays many tabs and inside those tabs are different panels with related content. It is form-oriented, so the panels have a read mode and edit mode where the displayed content is switched to an input field. However, on some panels the fields do not have any content to enter. When a field does not have any content in read mode we just show an empty space. The main reason for doing this is so that we do not confuse the user by adding and removing fields.

My question is when the panel does not contain a lot of fields (2-3) and one of those fields is a checkbox what would be the best way to indicate to the user that the field is empty without displaying just white space?


",Jason Frade,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/28189,"It depends...

One of the biggest challenges with ""data intensive"" is making sure the information is displayed is meaningful to what the user is trying to accomplish at that step.

So first, make sure you have the right information - and the right non-information, ie: the information NOT shown at this step also makes sense and it's expected to NOT be there. (Make sense?)

To answer your question using the simplified example you've shown above, you could do one of the following, but again, only if it makes sense given the task scenario:


Display nothing. But only if nothing actually means something that is mutually understood by all users.
Say nothing. Show some text that tells the user the input field was left blank, like literally: ""None"" or ""Intentionally left blank"" - but again, only if the words don't imply something they shouldn't be implying.
Use a visual cue. If this occurs often, you might want to use the same graphic to indicate the same situation - like an input box that's grayed out - so that the user knows it's possibly something to edit/modify versus a data point being automatically displayed or pulled in from elsewhere.


That's all I think of off the top of my head for now. Again, all of this is contingent on what the actual information is and how the user expects to interact with it, behaviorally or cognitively. 

P.S. For checkboxes, you can use Enabled/Disabled or On/Off - but again, I can't stress this enough because of how often these controls are used inappropriately - it depends on what it represents to the end user.

1230,How are messages from server secured when using SSL certificate,"In case of using SSL the certificate server has a primary key and a public key that is published to all clients - as far as I understood. So in this case when message is encrypted by public key (on client side) only the owner of private key (which is the server in this case) has ability to decrypt it.

But I do not understand how this works the other way, I mean when the message is encrypted by private key then does it mean that whoever has the public key can decrypt it? That would mean that only the messages toward the server are secured and messages which come from the server can be read by anybody with public the key.

Update:
in my case I have web server in DMZ hosts multiple web services (WCF), the clients are non-server application (they are standalone .NET application) reaching these web services via internet using https protocol.

My server has SSL certificate issued by Versign, the point is that my client do not have any type of credential and any machine with that application (or similar app) should be able to consume the services, the point is that the information passing between client machine and server must be encrypted and signed, so this is my question is having the certificate and using the transport security enough to make sure that nobody can read the messages passing between client and server or do I have to somehow come up with some kind of ad hoc client credential and add message security.

1249,Can Gauss' and Ampere's Laws be written in terms of the divergence of an energy four-vector?,"In the first 20 minutes of this video, Susskind derives the continuity equation for charge conservation:

$$\dot{\rho}+\nabla\cdot\vec{J}=0$$

(Where $\vec{J}=\frac{\partial\dot{q}^m}{\partial A^m} \:; \:\:\:m=1,2,3 \:\:$ is the current density, or as Susskind calls it, just the current.)

(And $m=1,2,3$ indexes the x,y,z space components)

And then shows that this continuity equation can be written more compactly as the divergence of a current four-vector:

$$\dot{\rho}+\nabla\cdot\vec{J}=\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{J}^{\mu}=0\:; \:\:\:\mu=0,1,2,3 \:\:$$

(Where $\mu=0$ indexes the time component.  For the rest of this post, a curly letter indicates a four vector, whereas a non-curly letter with an arrow over it indicates an ordinary vector with three space components.)

That is, he demonstrates that $\dot{\rho}$ can be thought of as the time component of the divergence of the current.

My main question is: if $\rho$ is a time component (i.e. differentiates w.r.t. to time), then doesn't Gauss' Law also have a more compact expression as the divergence of an Energy four-vector?  Here is the reasoning:

When the continuity equation is derived by taking the divergence of Ampere's Law we see that $\nabla\cdot \dot{E}=\dot{\rho}$.  Well, if $\rho$ is a time component, then this must mean that $\dot{E}=\rho$.  From this it follows that Gauss' Law can be written as the divergence of the Energy four-vector:

$$\nabla\cdot \vec{E}=\rho \:;\:\:\: \vec{E}=(E^1,E^2,E^3)\rightarrow \partial_{\mu}\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=0\:; \:\:\:\mu=0,1,2,3 \:\:$$

And as a corollary does it follow that the divergence of the current four-vector equals the Laplacian of the Energy four-vector?

$$\partial_{\mu}^2\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{J}^{\mu}$$

Reasoning: If $\rho$ is a time component, then the divergence of Gauss' Law gives:

$$\nabla^2\vec{E}=\dot{\rho}$$

...which, since $\dot{E}=\mathcal{E}^{0}=\rho$, can also be written

$$\partial_{\mu}^2\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=0$$

But by Susskind's compact expression of the continuity equation we know that $\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{J}^{\mu}=0$.  Therefore the two can be equated: $\partial_{\mu}^2\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{J}^{\mu}$.

And then finally, if this corollary is true, then doesn't it also follow that Ampere's Law has a more compact expression as:

$$\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=\nabla\times\vec{B}$$

Reasoning: By integrating both sides of the corollary you get:

$$\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=\mathcal{J}^{\mu}$$

But the RHS of this can also be written:

$$\mathcal{J}^{\mu}=\rho+\vec{J}$$

...which, since $\rho=\dot{E}$, is also:

$$\mathcal{J}^{\mu}=\dot{E}+\vec{J}$$

But the RHS of this is just Ampere's Law ($\nabla\times\vec{B}=\dot{E}+\vec{J}$).  Therefore Ampere's Law has the following compact expression in terms of the divergence of the energy four-vector:

$$\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=\nabla\times\vec{B}$$

From which a desirable property (I think) follows automatically--that the magnetic field is irrotational ($\nabla\times \vec{B}=0 $)--since the compact expression for Gauss' Law is $\partial_{\mu}\mathcal{E}^{\mu}=0$.
",ben,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/5626,"The covariant formulation of EM is precisely this. The formulation as a gauge theory also does this. ($c = 1$ in the following)

Given the $E$- and $B$-fields as spatial three-vectors in some frame, we construct the antisymmetric field strength tensor as (roman indices are spatial indices, summation over repeated indices implied)

$$ F^{0i} := E^i \; \text{and} \; F^{ij} := \epsilon^{ijk}B^k$$

Using the behaviour of the fields under Lorentz transformations, one can indeed see that this $F_{\mu\nu}$ is a proper tensor on Minkowski space. Similarly, we construct a four-current out of the classical current $\vec j$  and the charge density $\rho$ by

$$ j^i = j^i \; \text{and} \; j^0 = \rho$$

Maxwell's laws now simply read

$$ \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = \mu_0j^\nu \; \text{and} \; \partial_\mu \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\rho\sigma} = 0$$



This is not yet the most abstract way to present this. Using the language of differential forms, we have forms $F = F_{\mu\nu}\mathrm{d}x^\mu \wedge \mathrm{d}x^\nu$ and $j = j_\mu \mathrm{d}x^\mu$. Maxwell's laws now look, in their most concise form, like this:

$$ \mathrm{d}F = 0 \; \text{and} \; \mathrm{d}\star F = \star j$$

where the star is the Hodge dual. One advantage of this language is that one may conclude that there is a 1-form $A$ with $F = \mathrm{d}A$ on any contractible subset of our space. More precisely, it exists if the second deRham cohomology vanishes.

The gauge theory description of electrodynamics starts from gluing together these $A$ which always exist locally to get a globally defined gauge potential $A$.

1477,Does Shepard's background (Origin and Reputation) matter?,"So I started up the demo and it's asking me whether I'm a Spacer, Colonist, or Earthborn and whether I'm Ruthless, a War Hero, or a Sole Survivor.  Based on this forum thread it appears these choices didn't matter in ME1, it was barely mentioned, which seems strange given everything I've heard about your choices impacting the game.  Does it matter more in ME3?  Does it limit what you can do or significantly impact any character's dialog or attitude towards you?

For the demo in particular, it's practically irrelevant; the only reason it's in there at all is because the demo features the tutorial level, and it was probably more trouble than it was worth to remove it.

Or is this just the way it is supposed to be, because I have been running a couple of games that have nice graphics at maxed settings and I doubt the Intel could keep up with that...but I just can't figure out why it says Intel under Display Controller.

1700,Difference between sodium ion and a transition metal ion dissolving in water?,"In class, I learned that when $\ce{NaCl}$ is dissolved in water, the partially negative oxygen part of the water molecules surround the $\ce{Na+}$ ion and energy is given off (hydration enthalpy)

Likewise, when a transition metal ion like $\ce{Fe^2+}$ is dissolved in water, water molecules surround the ion. However, in this case, we say that a complex ion is formed.

Can someone please tell if there is really a difference in the two cases and if yes, could someone specify them.
",Eliza,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/2595,"There is a slight difference between solvated ions and aqua complexes: The nature of the bond.

When solvating a sodium ion, the electron pairs of the oxygen in water never really interact with the sodium in a way that creates a bond of some sort: It's all just electrostatic interactions.

However, when a transition metal ion gets surrounded with these water molecules, the lone pair electrons of the oxygen form a bond with the ion. This is because they interact with the $d$ orbitals of the transition metal (which usually also contains some electrons), thus changing the energetic state of the ion itself. First and second group elements don't have that energy-stabilizing effect because they don't have electrons in the orbitals that get split up by the formation of the complex.

It is not unimaginable that there then exist further electrostatic interactions between the transition metal aqua complex and the surrounding water molecules, thus leading to the solvation of said complex.

I have 81.5"" of ceiling clearance to the ceiling joists, and am in the process of framing in a door for a bedroom.  My question is, since this wall is not load bearing, is it required to have double studs, as there's no structural header to hold up.  In this case, due to clearance issues, the header is also the top-plate of the wall.

I've attached a rough picture to give you an idea of what I'm planning on doing.  

As you can see, the top plate extends the full length of the wall.  There is no room to install an additional plate as a header, the top plate will serve this function.  Since there's no normal header to hold up, is a jack stud needed, or no?  Is it ideal to provide support in the wall, or just not necessary?

1959,Bee Sharps sponsored by Albert Fink,"This is a question about the Bee Sharps, a barbershop quartet group we come across very early in the game. 



Spoilers in question below:


   The first time we see them, they are singing the God Only Knows a song released by the Beach Boys in 1966, some 50 years before the events in the game took place. The sign in the picture (partially obscured) says, ""The music of tomorrow today!"". Since the group is sponsored by the industrialist Jeremiah Fink brother Albert Fink, does that mean at some point he (or both of them) had access to the time rifts in the game? If not, who brought this piece of culture back to 1912? 

",Hooked,https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/9116,"Spoilers ahead, don't read until much later in the game, same deal as all the rest of the Bioshock Infinite questions.

Later on in the game, in a sort of side-exploration destination,


   you will find a tear in the house of Albert Fink, as you head back to Comstock house after finding the third tear. From it, you will hear a modern song (""Girls Just Want to have Fun"", of all things). Jerimiah Fink congratulates his brother for discovering such rifts in a Voxophone, saying ""Dear brother, these holes in the thin air continue to pay dividends. I know not which musician you borrow your notes from, but if he has half the genius of the biologist I now observe, well...then you are to be the Mozart of Columbia."" This implies that both of them had access to the tears.


Update

After digging through the Voxophone transcripts, I've found even more answers on the significance of this.

A voxophone found in Finkton Proper or in the Good Time Club recorded by Jeremiah Fink:


   ""I had thought you a fool, dear brother. When you told me that you heard wonderful music trumpetting from holes in the thin air. I began to doubt your mental integrity. But not only have you made your fortune from these doodads, you have lit the path for me as well.""


That voxophone doesn't have much significance until later, in the factory:


   ""These holes have shown me yet another wonder, though I've yet to see the application for it. They illuminate a merger of machine and man that is somehow the lesser, yet the greater, of both parties. The process seems to be irreversible. Perhaps, though, Comstock will have some need of this kind of thing to keep watch in that tower of his.""


This likely reveals the origin of


   the Handymen, Firemen, and possibly the Motorized Patriots.


The final voxophone loses significance, given these others:


   ""Dear brother, these holes in the thin air continue to pay dividends. I know not which musician you borrow your notes from, but if he has half the genius of the biologist I now observe, well...then you are to be the Mozart of Columbia.""


The real significance of the room...


   ...lies in the actual tear in the room, since before this point, it's not entirely clear what exactly Fink means by ""holes in the thin air""

  If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player's left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the ""Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order"" rule.


Canker Abomination's ability says


  As Canker Abomination enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. Canker Abomination enters the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter on it for each creature that player controls.


This is a replacement effect, as described in 614.1c. Clone, another creature with an enters-the-battlefield replacement effect, has a ruling on Gatherer that says


  If Clone somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Clone can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.


This means that when multiple permanents enter the battlefield simultaneously, they do not see each other when applying replacement effects.

Therefore, the spell resolves like this:


Exhume starts to resolve. Each player must choose a permanent in their graveyard to put on the battlefield.

Nicholas chooses his Canker Abomination.

Some electric violins are very heavy, this will hurt your back. Wood violins weight about 0,5 Kg
Check if the overtones are tuned. If the empty strings are tuned then the overtones should also be, otherwise it might be strange proportions in the instrument which will give you problems with intonation.
Try the sound. You have to like the sound of the instrument. Ask also what kind of pickup it has and check the cable exit is comfortable with your way of holding the violin.
Some instruments have nice electronics, like volume knobs and eq, this can be good but not essential. More features more weight and higher price.
Some E.Violin needs a battery inside. In that case you need to change it as a part of the maintenance, and have a spare battery around. Big advantage to violins with batter is that often you can play them with headphones anywhere without needing more power.

2075,How to store passwords to a remote web site?,"Say I want to build a public API to access a website that doesn't have one. The website is protected by a standard username/password scheme and the API implementation will use scraping to get the data from it.

What would be the best way to handle passwords in this scenario?

My current best idea is this. Get the username and password in an HTML form on my site (the same one that serves the API), and generated a URL to access the API that includes an encrypted blob of username+password. The encryption is symmetric AES256 based on a key stored only on the API server. When the user will access the API URL, the API server will decrypt the credentials and access the remote website.

As an additional level of protection, I'm thinking of running the API as CGI, so that only a short lived process is ever exposed to plaintext credentials.

Does that make any sense? Are there any standard solutions to this kind of problem?

[Edit]

Possible duplicate: How to store passphrase in this situation?
",gooli,https://security.stackexchange.com/users/64347,"Your current solution would work, however, you could keep the information on your server by tracking a session.  When a user sends their login credentials, you could store them in a database (possibly encrypted) and then issue them a unique session id (should be difficult to predict the session id, eg. crypto rand + hash).

Once the user has obtained the session key, they would send that id along with every request to your server.  When you verify that this session key is valid, you get the username/password out of the database, and make the request on behalf of the user.  After some amount of time, you'd invalidate this session key and delete it and the login information from your database.  This would help guard against replay style attacks.

If you include the actual login information and don't have some kind of age off, an attacker could obtain the URL used to access the system, and possibly make requests on behalf of the user.  Of course, this depends on how you set up the URL etc.

Typically though, this sort of situation is handled by storing the credentials locally in some sort of secure (e.g. encrypted) storage, and issuing some kind of temporal session identifier.

While there may be some benefit in using short running processes, it is likely more cost than benefit.  If an attacker is to the point at which they can read memory in your processes, the fact that the time in memory is short lived won't help much.  Furthermore, you are still probably storing the encrypted credentials somewhere on your server (e.g. http access logs), along with the encryption key (which I'm guessing is in a database).  If the attacker has access to both, the credentials will be compromised.  Depending on which language you're using to write application, there may be some way to zeroize memory once you're finished with the sensitive information.

If you use timestamps in the URL, you're going to need to make sure that the timestamp can't be tampered with (HMAC, AES-GCM etc).  Keeping credential data, encrypted or not, also represents a problem controlling information.  If you suspect your encryption key has been compromised, you can easily delete the credntials from your server.  If the credentials are in URLs potentially scattered all over the internet in browser caches etc, you won't be able to mitigate the leakage.

If you store the credentials in the database, along with whatever material you use to derive the key, you'll have much more control over the data.  Assuming you have your database application secured, it is arguably more secure.  I would suggest using different keys for each set of credentials, and using some kind of KDF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) to derive the key, instead of storing the key in plaintext in the database.  You could also include some portion of the key derivation material in the session id you issue to the user.

Of course, if someone has complete access to your server, including the database and/or the VA space of your CGI processes, the credentials will be comprimised, but that is true with nearly any solution.

If I were writing this application, I would use session ids to tie a user's requests to a set of credentials.  I would use a database table containing fields for the id, creation time, last seen time, username, password, and key derivation seed (this part depends on how you derive keys).  The session id I would issue to the user would be a large, hard to guess value (stored in the id field), combined with a portion of the material needed to generate the key (this material wouldn't be stored on the server, so both a valid session id and the material stored on the server are needed to decrypt the credentials).

For instance, a session id may look like this:

d7be62755db80ccefb7d802fde153145b6e9_bdb8f9bf599293fd65a020dba1ecd


The first part would be the id portion, and the second half part of the data needed to derive the key.

When a request is made, the id portion of the session id would be verified, and the decryption key generated using the key material portion supplied by the user (via the session id) and the portion stored in the database.  Once the key is generated, you'd decrypt and use the credneitals.

This way, if an attacker gains access to the database, they don't have everything they need to decrypt all of the credentials.  They'd need a session id for every set of credentials they wish to decrypt.

In order to age off sessions you could have a cron job, or some other mechanism, deleting expired sessions from the database.

While the texts are great at teaching the theory I would like to get a better handle on the pro's/con's of Bayesian analysis vs their frequentist equivalents. 

I can't find an article or even articles that do this. I really want it as a fairly high level rather than getting caught up in the technical detail right away. Ideally highlighting where and in what situations Bayesian is better and vice versa.

Most just hint that the frequestist approaches also rely on prior information but are less honest about this, but it didn't go into much detail.
",Baz,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/25973,"Bayesian and Frequentist statistics rest upon a different understanding of what a probability distribution is. To a Bayesian, probability reflects degree of belief. The purpose of an experiment (or data collection) is to update one's beliefs about the parameter values of the system. And since our beliefs concern parameters (unknown) rather than data (which we see), a probability distribution is attached to the parameters. Confusingly, a pdf is also attached to the data.

To a frequentist, a probability distribution reflects the frequency with which events occur. A theoretical distribution is (in theory), the (measure theoretic) limit of the observed frequency distributions. The observed frequency distribution must, in turn, reflect the sampling scheme used to collect the data, since what is at issue is the probability of given items showing up in the sample you select.

But you know all this. 

I did my doctorate at CMU, when Morrie Degroot and Jay Kadane were there. It was a big Bayesian shop in those days, and perhaps still is. At no time did anyone talk about the cost-benefits of Bayesian vs frequentist analyses. It was a simple question of right vs wrong. No one at CMU would have thought of using a Bayesian method for time series (say), but not in everything else. This may account for the absence of papers on this subject. 

In general, Bayesian methods cost more than frequentist ones, since the calculations are more complex and laborious. That used to matter. Now it doesn't, which may explain the proliferation of Bayesian methods. 

There is also a mental cost involved with Bayesian methods, since you have to justify to yourself why, in an exploratory situation where you know nothing and you have an apparently symmetric and Normal-like sample, the sample average is not an acceptable estimate of the mean. And don't get me started on improper priors. Improper priors mean that you can only justify the sample mean by using mathematical techniques only a graduate student in analysis could understand. And yet ordinary people use sample averages all the time. You can justify OLS and the mean without reference to probability at all (see linear algebra and basic calc). Why not do so?

Fequentists do not ""rely on prior information"". Frequentists, like everyone else, have assumptions and build these into their models. Frequentists do not apply probability distributions to those parameters of the system that are of scientific interest. I put it this way to get around latent variable models and hiercharchical or empirical Bayes models.

2180,How to check if current user is permitted to create personal site and create it on demand,"Given the following situation:

Within our company's farm the creation of MySites / PersonalSites is limited to members of a special AD Group (""MysiteCreator"").

This group has been given the following permissions within the User Profile Service:



All the other, ""casual"" users are not permitted to create a MySite / Personal Site.

Now I'm wondering how to check by code if the current user is permitted to create a personal site and then create it on demand.

I've read some posts about checking the UserProfile.PersonalSiteCapabilities == ""14"" (see here and here). So I wrote this piece of code:

internal bool EnsurePersonalSite()
{
  UserProfileManager upm = new UserProfileManager(SPServiceContext.Current);
  UserProfile up = upm.GetUserProfile(true);

  // User not permitted (?) to create personal site
  if ((up.PersonalSiteCapabilities &amp; PersonalSiteCapabilities.Social)
    != PersonalSiteCapabilities.Social)
  {
    return false;
  }

  // User permitted ==&gt; create personal site
  up.CreatePersonalSiteEnque(true);
  return false;

  // Creation ongoing
  if (up.PersonalSiteInstantiationState != PersonalSiteInstantiationState.Created
    || up.PersonalSite == null)
  {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}


The casual user has a PersonalSiteCapabilities == 0 entry in his user profile (shown in Central Administration). Adding the user to the ""MysiteCreator"" AD group does not change this value to 14 and my code will always return false.

If I would set PersonalSiteCapabilities = 14 for all users my code will always return true no matter if the user is member of the AD Group ""MysiteCreator"" or not.

So what's the best, safest way to ensure a MySite / Personal Site for users only belonging to a special AD group?

2203,How do I prove that in every commuting family there is a common eigenvector?,"The proof given by my textbook is highly non-satisfying. The author adopted some magic-like ""reductio ad absurdum"" and the proof (although is correct) didn't reveal the nature of this problem. I made my own effort into it and tried a different approach. Yet I can't finish it.

Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a commuting family in $M_n(\mathbb{C}^n)$, and $A\in\mathscr{F}$, then $A$ has $n$ eigenvalues. We pick one, say $\lambda$. Let $x$ be one of its eigenvector.

We can easily prove that, if $A$ has no other eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$ that linearly independent with $x$, which means that $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$ are the only vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$, then $x$ is a common eigenvector. Because $\forall B\in\mathscr{F}$ and $\forall y\in \{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$, $$A(Bx)=ABx=BAx=B(Ax)=B(\lambda x)=\lambda (Bx)$$, so that $Bx$ has to be in $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$, that is, $Bx=c_0x$ for some $c_0\in\mathbb{C}$, which means $x$ is a eigenvector of $B$ too.

But what if there are vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$ that's not in  $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$? Well, then we should have a set of linearly independent eigenvectors $\{x_1,x_2,...,x_k\}$, that $\{c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_kx_k|c_i\in\mathbb{C}\}$ are the only vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$.

Now, I have a reasonable hypothesis that there exists some $x=c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_kx_k$, that can be proven to be a common eigenvector of $\mathscr{F}$. I've tried some approaches to prove it but all failed.

Do you guys believe it's true? And if it is true then how do I prove it?
",Voldemort,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/8106,"Eureka! I figured it out! It's quite silly because in fact I was so close.

So yes, my hypothesis is true.

Actually, Since $W_1=\{c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_kx_k|c_i\in\mathbb{C}\}$ is obviously a subspace of $W_0=\mathbb{C}^n$, and we can easily deduce (same approach as the first part of my proof) that $Bx\in W_1$ as long as $x\in W_1$, we obtain that $B$ is $W_1$-invariant, or we can say $B$ is also a linear transformation on $W_1$, so that there are $k$ eigenvalues of $B$ in $W_1$.

Now, pick one of them, say $\lambda_B$. As we can clearly see it's the first part of my proof all over again. For any $C\in\mathscr{F}$, we can get a new subspace $W_2\subseteq W_1\subseteq W_0$, that $C$ is $W_2$-invariant, and go ahead we get $W_3\supseteq W_4\supseteq ...$

Note that, $W_0$ has a finite dimension $n$, and every time we have $1\le\dim{W_{i+1}}\le\dim{W_i}$ so there gotta be a subspace $$W_\infty=\bigcap_i{W_i}$$ with $\dim{W_\infty}\ge1$, that $\forall x\in W_\infty(x\ne 0)$ is an common eigenvector of all the matrices in $\mathscr{F}$.



As inspired by Matt.E's answer in that question, we know that $\forall A\in\mathscr{F}$, if $A$ has $k$ eigenvalues, then there are at least $k$ common eigenvectors in $\mathscr{F}$. Simply because we can do the same process for each of its eigenvalues.

2230,Matching BigInts in Scala,"I'm currently in the process of learning scala, and I'm looking for some best practices/proper idioms for the use of pattern matching with BigInts.  I'm writing some algorithmic code (for Project Euler) as a way to learn the language.

The problem I am running into is what is the best idiomatic way to match a BigInt, since there's a type conversion problem if I try to write case 1 =&gt; and BigInt isn't a case class.  Is there a canonical way to do this, or should I just give up and use if statements?

The following is one possible pattern:

def pollardRho(n: BigInt): BigInt = {
  val one = BigInt(1)

  n match {
    case `one` =&gt; n
    //additional cases here
  }
}


This one just feels wrong: A hack to get around the fact that I can't match it directly, especially with the backticks in there to keep scala from trying to assign the resulting value to one or when I have to do it for more than a single value or in a single case.

Another possibility:

def pollardRho(n: BigInt): BigInt = {

  n match {
    case _ if n == 1 =&gt; n
    //additional cases here
  }
}


This sort of pattern appeals to the Erlang programmer in me, but I have some concerns:


Given the warnings I've read not to treat Scala like any other language, I am not sure that my instinct here is not an anti-pattern (or at least considered less readable) in the scala world.
It feels like there might be cleaner way to use a custom PartialFunction instead of n match if what I am fundamentally going to do is just a series of tests around n.  I am not sure, however, exactly what that would look like (most of the examples of PartialFunctions I've seen don't look quite like this application).


My question is, out of the array of possibilities in scala, which one is the best/most readable/most idiomatic?

2387,How can I better take indoor photographs with wide aperture and low light?,"Recently I photographed an event for a friend as a favour using my Canon 750D, my 18-55mm stock and the 50mm f/1.8. The event was indoors, followed briefly by outdoors and then back indoors in a restaurant.

Whilst I did get lots of good photos, I immediately ran into two problems with the 18-55:


It wasn't so good in low light (such as both buildings) to the point I had to crank the ISO up (3200 in many cases) in order to get any kind of decent shutter speed in Av Priority. As a result, many of my photos were very grainy which needed work in Lightroom.
Any kind of wide aperture photography was extremely difficult. The widest setting of f3.5 was hard enough, but throwing in the high ISO to compensate for the low light meant that the shutter speeds were often too slow and capturing blur.


As a result, I switched to the 50mm f/1.8 prime and managed to get some great photos - except that the fixed focal length meant that many photos simply couldn't be taken (or had features clipped) because I couldn't physically get far enough away from the subject.

Given that I enjoyed that kind of indoor photography, what do I need to do to resolve these issues?


Buy a different prime that means I don't have to be in another room to take the photo?
Invest in a decent flash which I can bounce off the ceiling?
Something else?

",Richard,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/22870,"You've pretty much figured out your three options.


(Something else). f/2.8 zooms are the preferred choice for many event-shooting professionals  for the reasons you state. So, this is probably the most effective route, but also the most expensive.
Flash (and many pros will do this in combination with f/2.8 zooms) can also help immeasurably with this type of shooting by giving you a tool to create good exposures in lower light with smaller apertures and higher shutter speeds.
A wider fast prime, such as the EF 35mm f/2 IS USM, might also be worth considering.


Of these three choices, the best bang for the buck is actually liable to be the flash.  But for event shooting, you probably do not want to gt an all-manual cheapie like a Yongnuo YN-560, but rather a TTL-capable flash with 360-degree swivel, because bounce is going to be your go-to technique to diffuse the light and not get that harsh on-camera look most people associate with flash, and because you may not have time to dink the output light level in Manual, and having eTTL-II automation to get you in the ballpark can be a lifesaver if you're moving in and out of changing lighting situations.

2487,How do modalists understand the role of Jesus as mediator?,"The Bible calls Jesus our mediator:


  Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. (Romans 8:34, ESV)
  
  For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, (1 Timothy 2:5, ESV)
  
  Consequently, he [Jesus] is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. (Hebrews 7:25, ESV)


Trinitarians believe that Jesus intercedes with the Father on our behalf. He can do this because he is a distinct person, and he is the only competent mediator because only God can truly mediate with himself.

Modalism teaches that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are ""different modes or aspects of the One God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three coeternal persons within the Godhead."" (Wikipedia)

If God is not multiple people, how can Jesus intercede with the father? How do modalists understand the role of Jesus as mediator?
",curiousdannii,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/6071,"Who are the modalists?

The ancient modalists were condemned heretics such as Noetus, Sabellius, and Praxeas. We don't have much record of their own writings, and what we do know of them is based on what men like Tertullian and Hippolytus wrote in response to them. So we know very little of their actual theology.

In modern times, Oneness Pentecostalism has revived modalism. Though some of them reject the term modalism, many do not, and it's just about universal that that's exactly what they teach.

Note that Unitarianism is the opposite heresy. Oneness believers say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the same person, while Unitarians say that only the Father is fully God.

Jesus' role as mediator to Oneness believers

In researching this question, I emailed Jason Dulle of OnenessPentecostal.com. Here's what he said:


  Yes, Jesus is our mediator.  I think different Oneness adherents have
  different understandings of this.  Some would say his mediatoral role
  is limited to the crucifixion.  Others, such as myself, would say that
  role, while based on the atonement, is ongoing and will continue until
  the consummation of all things.  This is no more problematic for our
  position that the issue of Jesus' communication with the Father while
  on Earth.  The response is the same to both.  For more information on
  how I understand the Father-Son distinction, see Avoiding the Achilles
  Heels of Trinitarianism, Modalistic Monarchianism, and Nestorianism:
  The Acknowledgement and Proper Placement of the Distinction Between
  Father and Son, A Oneness View of Jesus' Prayers, and Jesus' Prayers:
  It Doesn't Take Two Persons to Tango.


Dulles seems to summarize the differences between various Oneness views pretty well. His own views are rather unusual within that schema (positing two minds within the Godhead), but you can see a fuller discussion of them by accessing the revision history for this post.

Other Oneness theologians I contacted are consistent with each other in how they understand Jesus' role as mediator, though as Dulles said, they demonstrate disagreement over how ""intercession"" is to be understood.

For example, on the Oneness Q&amp;A site Glorious Church, they affirm that ""his mediatorial role is limited to the crucifixion:


  1 Timothy 2:5-6 says, 'For there is one God and one Mediator between
  God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for
  all....' From a Oneness perspective, we point out that the Mediator is
  specifically identified as 'the Man.' This agrees with Colossians
  1:21-22, which says, 'And you, who once were alienated and enemies in
  your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of
  His flesh through death.' Clearly the mediation and reconciliation
  between God and men was accomplished by means of the death of the Man,
  Jesus Christ, on the cross. We see the crucifixion as the once and for
  all intercession. We do not believe the Man Jesus is continuing to
  intercede in a literal way. We also believe that the Man who was
  crucified was God the Father in the flesh. We can make a distinction
  between God and His humanity, but we never want to think of them as
  two separate beings.


But in other ways, they agree with Dulles and the other theologians I contacted, all of whom believe that Jesus still intercedes for the church.

I also emailed William B. Chalfant, who has published Ancient Champions of Oneness as well as a number of historical novels about Sabellius. Chalfant engaged in a lengthy discussion of the key verses. Here are the highlights:


  Of course, in my view, the term ""Mediator"" usually refers to someone
  fulfilling a designated role or position rather than necessarily
  dictating a discrete, substantive individual.
  
  ...
  
  We can admit that a ""mediator"" is a ""mediator"" between two parties,
  but, as Paul wrote, we must still conclude that ""God is One"" (Gal.
  3:20).
  
  It must be, then, that God has ""mediated"" through His incarnation as
  the Messiah.""God was in Christ"": that is the incarnation.
  
  The ""mediator"" is the ""man Christ Jesus"" and not a second divine
  person as some would have it.
  
  ...
  
  Notice in this passage [1 John 2:1-2] that Jesus is identified as
  the ""Paraclete"" by John, who also wrote the Gospel of John, where
  Jesus promises, after his earthly demise and resurrection, the coming
  of the ""Paraclete"". Oneness teachers identify Jesus as the ""Paraclete""
  (that is, the Spirit of Christ is the Holy Spirit"". Paul affirms that
  in teaching that there is ""one Spirit"" (Ephesians 4:4). And so we
  would see if there is any post-resurrection ""mediation"" is will be
  done by the Spirit of Christ (the Holy Spirit).
  
  ...
  
  Again, ""mediation"" seems to refer to the earthly ministry of the
  Incarnation (God the Father manifested in the flesh), while
  ""intercession"" is again accomplished by the risen Christ (who is God
  the Father manifested in the glorified flesh).
  
  In short, the terms ""mediator"", ""intercessor"", ""reconciliation"", when
  expressed in relation to the exigencies of the ""incarnation""
  (enfleshment of God the Father), who now subsists as the Eternal
  Spirit in the glorified Man Christ Jesus, in a substantive henosis
  or union.


I also emailed Stan Hallett of Apostolic-Voice.org. His words serve as a decent summary of Chalfant's:


  In my view He is intercessor or mediator because He is the door (John
  10:9).  No man comes to the Father but by Him (John 14:6).
  
  I do not believe that He needs to go a talk to the Father on our
  behalf as some other person of a Trinitarian Godhead, for all power
  was given to him in heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18).
  
  ...
  
  God needed to come to redeem man unto himself (Titus 2:13,14). The
  annual shedding the blood of bulls and sheep could not redeem us 
  (Hebrews 10:4). Therefore the scripture says that God redeemed us with
  His own blood.
  
  ...
  
  God did not send someone else to pay the price for sin, He came
  Himself.


The common view of each of these theologians can be summarized as:

Being a separate person is unnecessary for mediation. The game-changer of the incarnation accomplished enough on its own. I believe each of them would affirm this statement whole-heartedly, with the possible exception of Dulles, who would give it a bit more nuance.

2569,How do I tent a ceiling?,"My fiancé and I are trying to tent our bedroom ceiling. We bought enough fabric from the fashion district downtown and got set up and ready to do it... and nothing was working or looking right.

As of now we have fabric lining the outside of our ceiling hanging down that is long enough to reach the center of the room.

The look is kind of a fancy Moroccan look we are going for. Not TOO drapey but not so tight that there are no creases.

Looking for a mixture of these two looks:



",needsurf,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/1762,"the effect can be achieved by getting something like a hula hoop (cut it open) or a piece of small gauge metal rod bent in to a circle. then sew a pocket along the edge of the fabric, like a pair of pants or hood with a draw string. thread the rod or hula hoop through, then do something to close the loop. with the hula hoop, i would recommend a dowel that fits snugly and a screw. for the rod, i recommend a small piece of tubing with hose clamps. affix the ring to the ceiling in the middle of the room.

temporarily affix planks of wood (something like 1x2 pine or thinner) to the walls all around the room, against the ceiling. stretch the fabric to the walls, and use a second piece of wood to sandwich the fabric, clamping it between the pieces of wood. when you have the look you like, screw the pieces of wood together. don't trim the excess yet!

remove the wood/fabric/wood sandwich from the walls, turn the wood 270 degrees, and affix it to the ceiling. to be able to do this, you can strategically cut holes in the fabric that will be invisible when you're done because of the natural creases you have created. through these holes you can screw the sandwich to the ceiling.

once you've decided that you like the look/positioning/whatever, you can cut off the excess.

  Integers (strictly) between 0 and 1 form the basis of transcendental number theory.


What does this mean? Is there a different, more relaxed, definition of an integer used for transcendental number theory?
",Hooked,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/196,"Many proofs in transcendental number theory reach a contradiction by coming up with a quantity which on the one hand is a positive integer, and on the other hand is less than one.

A particular simple example is the proof that $e$ is irrational. Suppose $e = p/q$. Then for $r \geq q$,
$$r!e = \sum_{n \leq r} \frac{r!}{n!} + \frac{1}{r+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{r+2} + \frac{1}{(r+2)(r+3)} + \cdots \right).$$
Now consider the quantity
$$ \frac{1}{r+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{r+2} + \frac{1}{(r+2)(r+3)} + \cdots \right). $$
On the one hand, it's a positive integer. On the other, as $r\to\infty$ it tends to 0.

2607,The meaning of a definition involving multiple sums with Bernoulli numbers,"Reading a paper regarding Bernoulli numbers, and I stumbled onto a definition.  First let
$$\frac{x}{e^x-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}B_k\frac{x^k}{k!}$$
The author then goes on to define new terms.
Let
$$\beta_n=(-1)^n\frac{B_n}{n}, n\ge 1$$
noting that $\beta_n=B_n/n$ except for $\beta_1=-B_1=1/2$ since $B_n=0$ when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.  Now he defines
$$\beta_n^{(j)}=\frac1{j!}\sum_{i_1+i_2+...+i_j=n}\binom{n}{i_1,i_2,...,i_j}\beta_{i_1}...\beta_{i_1}$$
I'm not even sure where to start with this, but, I suppose I'm confused about the role of the bound $i_1+i_2+...+i_j=n.$  I would have to say that the sum of the $i_k$'s are integer partitions of a number $n$.  Should I take this as unique integers?  Or is this simply all possible integer partitions of $n$? So for $n=4$, so i take
$$\{4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, 1+1+1+1\}$$
or 
$$\{4, 3+1, 1+3, 2+2, 2+1+1, 1+2+1, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1\}$$
And what of the $j$?  So this tells me, for example if $j=2$ that my summation is 
$$\beta_4^{(2)}=\frac{1}{2!}\left[\binom{4}{2,2}\frac{B_2}{2}\frac{B_2}{2}+\binom{4}{3,1}\frac{B_3}{3}\frac{B_1}{1}\right]$$
Or do i have to include the case of $\binom{4}{1,3}$.  Or am i completely off to begin with?
",Eleven-Eleven,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/61030,"Looking at formula (4) at the top of page 3 of the paper makes it clear that Gessel uses the usual convention, in which summation over $i_1+\cdots+i_j = n$ is a summation over all non-negative integers $i_1,\ldots,i_j$ which sum to $n$, rather than all partitions. In the case of (4) we also have a lower bound on $i_1,\ldots,i_j$. If he wanted to sum over all partitions he would have added the condition $i_1\geq\cdots\geq i_j$, so in (4), instead of $i,j,k \geq 2$ he would have had $i\geq j\geq k\geq 2$.

Reading further down the paper, the definition you quote, formula (5), appears on the top of page (4), followed by the description ""where the sum is over positive integers $i_1,\ldots,i_j$"". Again, it is not mentioned that $i_1,\ldots,i_j$ are ordered.

I imagine the proof uses the Mean Value Theorem but I have not been able to get it to work.

I know $|f(x)|=|f&#39;(c)|(x-a)$ where $c \in [a,x]$, so $|f(x)| \leq A\  |f(c)|(x-a)$ where $c\leq x$ And I guess I could sort of iterate this to keep getting a smaller $c$ but I don't see why it must go all the way to zero.

&amp; \le |f(d)||A(x-a)|^2.
\end{align}
Now suppose there exists $c \in ]a,x[$ such that $|f(x)| \le |f(d)| |A(x-a)|^n$, by induction on $n$. Then
\begin{align}
|f(x)| &amp; \le |f(c)||A(x-a)|^n = |f(c) - f(a)||A(x-a)|^n \\
&amp; = |f'(d)||d-a||A(x-a)|^n \le A|f(d)||d-a||A(x-a)|^n \\
&amp; \le |f(d)||A(x-a)|^{n+1}. 
\end{align}
Hence for every integer $n$ there exists $c_n$ such that $|f(x)| \le |f(c_n)||A(x-a)|^{n+1}$. Since $[a,b]$ is compact and $f$ is differentiable, $f$ is continuous, hence $|f|$ is continuous and attains a maximum $M$ over $[a,b]$, so that $|f(x)| \le |f(c_n)| |A(x-a)|^n \le M|A(x-a)|^n$. This means $f(x) = 0$ as long as $|x-a| &lt; \frac 1A$, since the bound only depends on $n$, hence we can let it go to infinity. By continuity of $f$ you also get $f(x) = 0$ if $|x-a| \le \frac 1A$.

Since you can split the interval $[a,b]$ as $[a,a+\frac 1A]$, $[a+\frac 1A, a + \frac2A]$, $\dots$, $[a+\frac mA, b]$, you can repeat this process finitely many times and show that $f$ is zero over $[a,b]$.

2670,How do I request a read receipt when sending e-mail with Outlook for Mac 2011?,"I've been using MAC OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. How do I request a read receipt when sending e-mail with Outlook for Mac 2011? 
",Selahattin,https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/62748,"To make Mac OS X Mail request a read receipt for every message you send:


Open Terminal and run the following command:

defaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders

If that command returns


  The domain/default pair of (com.apple.mail, UserHeaders) does not exist


run the following replacing Name with your name and email@address with your email address

defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{""Disposition-Notification-To"" = ""Name &lt;email@address&gt;""; }'


For example, the complete line could read

defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{""Disposition-Notification-To"" = ""Heinz Tschabitscher &lt;sender@example.com&gt;""; }'""

If the ""defaults read"" command above returns a line of values that starts with { and ends in }:


Highlight the entire line. It might read something like {Bcc = ""bcc@example.com""; }, for example.
Press Command-C.
Type defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '
Press Command-V.
Type '.
Insert ""Disposition-Notification-To"" = ""Name &lt;email@address&gt;""; in front of the closing } character, replacing Name with your name and email@address with your email address.

For example, the line might now read

defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{Bcc = ""bcc@example.com""; ""Disposition-Notification-To"" = ""Heinz Tschabitscher &lt;sender@example.com&gt;""; }'

2691,Why was Ryuk tied to Light's Death Note?,"In How to Use: XIII, in the second point it says


  The god of Death always remains with the owner of the Death Note.


indicating that a Shinigami will remain with the owner of their Death Note, Light learns this and gathers a group of friends to try and hide himself with Ryuk following him when Misa is trying to find him (she finds him because of her Eyes)

However, the Death Note Light had in the beginning isn't Ryuk's but Sidoh's which Ryuk stole, and unlike Gelus who died and Rem probably obtained ownership of Gelus's Death Note afterwards, Sidoh was still alive so even if Light became the owner after Ryuk dropped it in the human world, the Shinigami who was supposed to be with like was Sidoh.

Also in How to Use 2, the second point says


  The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner, i.e. a god of death. 


So is there an explanation as to how Ryuk was tied with Light's Death Note having stolen it from Sidoh?
",Memor-X,https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/1587,"According to How to use II:


  The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner, i.e. a god of death.


Therefore the only explanation for Light being able to see Ryuk would be, that Ryuk is the original owner. But how did Ryuk become the owner of Sidoh's Death Note? As I explained at How did Ryuk trick the King of Death Gods?, it is because of How to Use XII:


  If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen, you will lose its ownership unless you retrieve it within 490 days.


Ryuk became owner of Sidoh's Death Note because of this rule. It wasn't until chapter 65 that Sidoh realized that he had lost his Death Note, which is 6 years after Ryuk first dropped the Death Note down to earth. If it took him at least 6 years to realize he had lost his Death Note, it would be safe to assume that Ryuk had already found the Death Note 490 days before he dropped it down to earth, claiming ownership and becoming tied to that particular Death Note.

2763,Validate Category Attribute,"I have extended Mage_Catalog_Model_Category_Attribute_Source_Mode (and it's Resource model) to add two new modes display_mode values for Categories. Now I want to validate the value of that attribute when saving a category. Specifically, I want to make sure that is_anchor is always set to ""No"" when either of my two new modes are selected.

The problem is that neither Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute_Backend_Abstract::beforeSave nor Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Attribute_Backend_Abstract::validate dispatch any events that I can listen for.

Mage_Catalog_Model_Category also has no _beforeSave method.

How can I validate category attributes on save? Thanks!
",Tyler V.,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/5694,"Actually Mage_Catalog_Model_Category does possess the event _beforeSave(). In order to see that, you need to look on that class with wide eyes :)

Mage_Catalog_Model_Category directly does not define _beforeSave. However you can see that, this class inherits from another class Mage_Catalog_Model_Abstract and it does possess _beforeSave. It looks like this

 protected function _beforeSave()
{
    $this-&gt;unlockAttributes();
    return parent::_beforeSave();
}


You can see that, this class again call its parent class. That parent class is nothing but Mage_Core_Model_Abstract. There you can see that _beforeSave defined like this.

protected function _beforeSave()
{
    if (!$this-&gt;getId()) {
        $this-&gt;isObjectNew(true);
    }
    Mage::dispatchEvent('model_save_before', array('object'=&gt;$this));
    Mage::dispatchEvent($this-&gt;_eventPrefix.'_save_before', $this-&gt;_getEventData());
    return $this;
}


This function dispatches two events. Second one is important here. You can see that, it uses an event prefix in that event. Now take a look on Mage_Catalog_Model_Category. You can see that, it actually defines an event prefix there.

protected $_eventPrefix     = 'catalog_category';


This means, whenever category section is trying to save, _beforeSave method generates a unique event with name catalog_category_save_before. I think , you can use that event to save any category attribute

Hope that helps

",Jörn Lund,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/35723,"Finally I found a solution on my own.

There is no direct way to pass pure binary data (like a blob) to the WP upload object. Only File based objects will be processed.
I had to create a separate XmlHttpRequest. (Simply using $.ajax() did not work and resulted in polluted Image data.)

After successfully uploading the image data to async-upload.php I was able to fire a 'FileUploaded' event, along with what the server responded. After this the image showd up in the media library.

2789,Excel 2007 Ability to have other access the sheet with same format,"I created an excel spread sheet that fits exactly on my screen and saved it in a shared drive so my team mates can access it.  It has some macros and other sheets on the right side of the main spreadsheet.  The macros are used to jump from one spreadsheet to another.

When my team mate loaded the same spreadsheet, the spread sheet does not fit their screen and when I jump to the next spredsheet using the same coordinate, that is f5 AE1 for example, the spreadsheet does not fit exactly on the screen (but it does on my computer).

Also, the buttons with macros do not work.  What do I have to do in order to make it work in their computer?
",D DeJesus,https://superuser.com/users/163481,"
In Windows world it is not a good strategy to assume any specific screen resolution, because in Excel you can't really control the absolute position of items in the screen. Excel is built with the assumption, that it is up to the user to adjust document zoom, windows size and screen resolution. But if you insist, you can control any of these settings through VBA, although some of them might require more privileges (for instance the local policy can deny the user right to adjust the screen resolution) and in general it will require a lot of work from your side.
Macro execution is disabled in Excel by default. There are at least three ways to enable it: a) enable macro execution globally, b) put the worksheet in the ""trusted"" path (or make the path where the worksheet resides ""trusted""), c) by clicking ""yes"" in the pop-up bar which asks whether run macros from this particular workbook this one time. Because of security concerns, it is by design impossible to alter the macro security policy through VBA. The user must to it himself manually (although I believe you can bypass it through 3-rd party automation tools like AutoIt, but I don't recommend it.)

2797,Is it possible to extend the reach of a pn532 NFC/RFID shield?,"I am working off an Arduino UNO with an AdaFruit pn532 NFC/RFID shield. The goal is to have a shoe box, with a false bottom. Under that false bottom would be my prototype, which hopes to be able to detect any mifare tag that is in the box, above the false bottom.

The range obviously for these devices is practically touching, but I was wondering if there is any way to extend the reach of the NFC/RFID shield, so that the entire false bottom of the box could act as that antenna?
",erik,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/52669,"Adafruit's PN532 board has been meticulously designed in order to get the maximum range out of it: PN532 - Breakout Board. That being said it is possible to increase the range by using a powered(active) tag instead of an unpowered (passive) tag. 

For your problem it sounds like it needs to remain passive, but so long as you get the antenna to be as close to the top of the shoebox as possible and are using of the larger ones like Adafruit's reader and there is NO METAL ANYWHERE near the reader it should be enough to read most tags from a reasonable distance.

So why can't you increase the range for a passive tag?

The electromagnetic field between the two which is used to communicate information falls off rather dramatically as you get further from the source, which makes it increasingly difficult to power the tag. 

So without going into deep physics, in order to increase the range of the PN532 board you need to either increase the diameter of the coil, which increases the size of the electromagnetic field, and/or increase the power output through the coil.

The approximate equation for the area of the radius in respect to the desired read range is:

$$ a = \sqrt{2r}$$

Where \$a\$ is the area of the coil and \$r\$ is the read distance from the coil.

But this causes issues as well, in order to increase the diameter of the coil you need to increase the length of the trace which increases the total resistance of the system and decreasing the effectiveness of the coil. 

That ignored modifying the antennae changes the inductance of the antennae, the row of capacitors leading to the antennae is a frequency and impedance matching circuit, changing the antenna means that you need to modify all of those components in order to get it work.

Or we could supply more power, except the PN532 has an upper limit on the amount of power it can push through the antenna, which makes this unreasonable. So you would have to build your own RFID reader.

The simplest ever designed is here, it is designed for 125khz not 13.56mhz but in theory you can push however much information you want through this coil and it will continue to function(granted you would have to protect whatever is reading the coil...)

2844,gam models with random effect R,"I am modeling fishery CPUE as a function of a number of a number of covariates using a GAM approach that includes fixed and random effects. 

I understand that there are limitations with regards to predicting random effects (predict function only addresses fixed effects) with gamm4. How does the predict function in the basic gam (mgcv, using bs=""re"") deal with the random effects? Are they included in predictions? Any thoughts would be much appreciated...
",Peterson,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/81118,"Yes, they are included, but only ever for the observed levels of the random factor. You can turn this using the by variable smooth trick however.

Consider the following example taken from ?gam.models:

dat &lt;- gamSim(1,n=400,scale=2) ## simulate 4 term additive truth

## Now add some random effects to the simulation. Response is 
## grouped into one of 20 groups by `fac' and each groups has a
## random effect added....
fac &lt;- as.factor(sample(1:20,400,replace=TRUE))
dat$X &lt;- model.matrix(~fac-1)                                  #$ rendering bug
b &lt;- rnorm(20)*.5
dat$y &lt;- dat$y + dat$X%*%b

rm1 &lt;- gam(y ~ s(fac, bs=""re"") + s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + s(x3),
           data = dat, method = ""ML"")


Now lets get the additive term contributions from the model and compare them with the full blown model predictions:

p &lt;- predict(rm1, type = ""terms"")
head(rowSums(p) + attr(p, ""constant""))
head(predict(rm1, type = ""response""))


which gives

&gt; head(rowSums(p) + attr(p, ""constant""))
        1         2         3         4         5         6 
14.265260  6.433342  2.766193 12.864771  5.296381  7.341790 
&gt; head(predict(rm1, type = ""response""))
        1         2         3         4         5         6 
14.265260  6.433342  2.766193 12.864771  5.296381  7.341790


So we are convinced now that the two ways of generating the predicted values are equivalent. now look at p the additive term contributions to the fitted values:

&gt; head(p)
       s(fac)      s(x0)     s(x1)      s(x2)        s(x3)

6 -0.05481148  0.3490905 -1.216908  0.3411783  0.126251294


The first column is the s(fac) which was a random effect spline in the fitted GAM.

I will add that the gamm() function also in mgcv can give the within-group predictions (fitted values):

m2 &lt;- gamm(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + s(x3),
           data = dat, method = ""ML"",

",Reckoning,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7425,"
  Why can't both of them be written in the same way? Does it matter? Is there a difference?


Yes, there is a difference, and it does matter! The placement of subscripts and coefficients tells you how the substances are put together on the atomic level.

Let's look at the first equation:

$$
\ce{2Li + S -&gt; Li2S} 
$$

This one indicates that two moles of lithium combine with one mole of sulfur to form one mole of lithium sulfide. $\ce{Li2S}$ is called a formula unit or empirical formula, and tells you the smallest whole-number ratio of atoms that make up a ""building block"" of the compound. In this case, the smallest building block of a lithium sulfide crystal would contain two lithium ions for every one sulfide ion. Here's a picture from wikipedia to demonstrate:



From this, we can learn that:


  Coefficients tell us the number of moles, molecules, or formula units of a species


and


  Subscripts tell us how many atoms or ions there are within a compound


Now if we look at the second equation:

$$
\ce{2Al + 3Br2 -&gt; 2AlBr3}
$$

we can see that in this case, it take 2 moles of aluminum to combine with three moles of bromine to produce two moles of aluminum tribromide. If it were instead $\ce{Al2Br6}$, that would indicate a different formula unit - it would imply a different compound.

So to answer your question:


  Why is Lithium in the first reaction written with a small 2, while in the second one Aluminium is written with a big 2


This is because in the first equation, the product has two lithium ions for every one sulfur in the formula unit, while in the second, two moles of aluminum tribromide are produced for every two moles of aluminum, but the formula unit contains only one aluminum atom and three bromine atoms.

For your final question:


  How do I tell which one to use?


You would have to know what the formula of the product is. In these examples, you can predict it by assuming that they are ionic compounds and balancing charges. You would get the correct answer, even though this assumption is not true for the second equation (it is actually a covalent compound, and you would just get the right answer by luck).

2912,Convergence in probability of a product of RVs,"I have found the following very useful theorem and I would appreciate some help comprehending it fully.

Theorem  Let $\{X_n \} $ be a sequence of random variables bounded in probability and let $ \{Y_n \} $ be a sequence of RVs which converge to $0$ in probability. Then

$$X_n Y_n \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{in probability} $$ 

And its proof:

For a given $\epsilon$ since $X_n$ is bounded in probability we can choose $N$ and a constant $B$ such that 

$$n \geq N \Rightarrow P \left[ |X_n| \leq B \right] \geq 1-\epsilon$$

Then

$$ \overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}}P \left[|X_n Y_n| \geq \epsilon \right] \leq \overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} P \left[ |X_n Y_n| \geq \epsilon, |X_n| \leq B \right]+ \overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}}P \left[|X_n Y_n| \geq \epsilon, |X_n| &gt; B \right] \leq \overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} P\left[|Y_n| \geq \epsilon/B \right] +\epsilon=\epsilon  $$

If someone could help me understand how the last inequality is derived, given the information we have, I would be grateful. I understand the second to last inequality comes from the subadditivity property of limitsuperior so I merely need to comprehend the last one. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: I think it is because $$P(A) \times P(B|A) \leq P(A) $$ and the complement of the event that is implied by the bound in probability.

NOTE: These are the telnet responses on port 22, not the OpenSSH banner text for my server (which would be unreachable in such situations)

How do I control this text? -- So I can insert a token that would identify my own server as the one being pinged in this situation. The datacenter servers accepting the port 22 requests may possibly have the exact same version of OpenSSH running on them as my own remote server.

(Currently my diagnostics is just reporting failed login, but there are other reasons this can happen - I'm looking for a more fine-grained diagnostic that can test to see if my server is really reachable on port 22 before I attempt a real login)

3034,Am I required to replace a non code compliant balustrade?,"I am purchasing a flat in Brisbane, Queensland Australia. Prior to purchase, I had the building inspected and they've noted that the balcony balustrade doesn't meet height requirements for my jurisdiction. 

Specifically:


The balcony is more than 1 meter above the ground.
The balustrade is not quite 1 meter high.


The structure was built in the 1970s, prior to the regulations being put into place. If I take ownership of the property as is, am I obligated to replace the balustrade?
",Anthony,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/13052,"We would have to talk to your building department to answer that question.  For something like this there may be a serious safety issue.  If a small child got hurt or someone got knocked over you would be liable if you didn't fix it and knew about it...

It is customary in the US to get the replacement cost of something that isn't code built into the price of the house.  If it costs $1000 to fix then I would expect to pay about 1K less for the house.  Also in the US (and I am pretty sure Australia) that you must disclose the issue to other potential buyers once one inspection finds the issue.  Meaning too that if you buy the house and potentially want to sell you have to tell everyone looking at your house about the issue.

Also you might need to think out of the box.  I don't have a picture of your balcony but if it is pretty close to 1 meter - then how about a decorative top plate on top of your current setup?  This would be cheap, easy, and a DIY.

So I recommend not using your phone vibrator to activate something like a solenoid to control mains electricity.

Search for ""home electricity control"". You will find lots of products which can turn mains power on and off.

Search for ""home electricity control wifi"" and you will find products which can turn power on and off, and which can be contacted remotely via the internet. 

Once you have control of the mains, and you still want to use your phone, then look at writing an app on that home phone, which talks locally to the mains-controller. If you have a smart phone, e.g. Android, iPhone, etc. then you should be able to write an app relatively easily (there is probably one available already).

3173,"Aligning coordinate systems: gpx, LiDAR, shapefile","I am working on a project based on a lidar data set (for use in LidarViewer in Linux, a basic x,y,z viewer) that was downloaded from #1 below at Opentopo.org and looking to add onto this data set with a shapefile based layer and a gpx based layer. 

In ArcMap 10.0 I am converting the shapefile (road perimeter around lake) into points, then Defining the Projection in Arc Toolbox's Projections and Transformation.  Since Opentopo stated UTM Zone 10, I set that to the roads shapefile, exported, completed my .shp to .las(lidar file) conversion and sent it to LidarViewer.  In LidarViewer my LiDAR data (only a section of the lake's perimeter) is floating the in the middle of the lake (with perspecitve to the road points).  

So, I switched the Tahoe to the original NAD27 in ArcMap, went through the process again with no change in position. Do I have to have a shapefile based on NAD83 for this to work, or is there another way?

Lidar viewer imports .las or .txt/.csv files and only reads a x,y,z no coordinate system whatsoever. 

The other related question is with the .gpx data that I am downloading from the #3 below, it is a .gpx file of a bike path around the perimeter of the lake. I am using the following link to convert .gpx into a text file (to process and import into Lidar Viewer) and the site provides the ability to output long/lat plus UTM coordinates (the output included both zone 10 and 11 South ) This .gpx file also does not project correctly. I was thinking that I should possible try another converter?  

gpsvisualizer .com  convert_format=gpx

Any input regarding the above two questions are appreciated, I can also further clarify any issues that may not seem clear. 

Thanks!

",Paul M.,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/8697,"You are on the right track as far as trying to match up the coordinate systems of all of your datasets.  The problem you are encountering is not so much a problem of the software projecting the data incorrectly, but of using the wrong operation to define the projection of your data.

This answer directly discusses the difference between the Define and Project commands in ArcGIS.  It also has links to the relevant ESRI help files discussing the different commands.

Let's start with what factors you are able to control.


You have a shapefile that defines your roads around Lake Tahoe, in UTM Zone 10 NAD 27, from the USGS.  Generally, spatial data from there is going to have the projection already defined, meaning that when you look at the properties in ArcMap, it will list the Coordinate System.  You can use ArcGIS to Reproject this layer as necessary, in this case, to the UTM Zone 10 NAD 83 Meters, projection.  
You have a .gpx file of GPS coordinates that defines a bike trip.  You have the ability to convert this to a file of coordinates in either Lat/Lon or UTM.  This file could then be brought into ArcGIS and reprojected as necessary.  
You know the projection of the Lidar data from opentopography.org.  It is UTM Zone 10N NAD 83 Meters.


The one thing you are unable to change, because of the format, is the Lidar data, which you are going to read using the LidarViewer software.  You thus, must ensure that the coordinate systems of all the other data layers, matche the Lidar, since you will be importing the other data into the Lidarviewer as well, to overlay.

Here is the process.


Look at the Roads shapefile.  In ArcMap, if you look at the properties, and shows that it has a coordinate system defined, you will need to use the Project command to Reproject the data from UTM 10 NAD 27, to UTM 10 NAD 83.  
a.  Convert the .gpx data using the website, and save as Lat/Lon.  This should give you a text file of coordinates in degrees.
b.  Add this using the Add X/Y Data command in ArcGIS, specifying the coordinate system as:  Geographic:  NAD 83.
c.  Use the Project tool on this new layer, and choose the UTM Zone 10, NAD 83 Meters coordinate system as your output.


What you should end up with is all 3 input layers being in the same coordinate system.  You can now import them into the LidarViewer and they should overlay properly.

A note about the LidarViewer software:  Even though it does not support coordinate systems directly, it will still overlay layers properly if they are all in the same coordinate system to begin with.  This simply means that all of the projection has to be performed prior to the data import.

3207,Hypergraph coloring,"I am investigating whether the following hypergraph is $2$-colorable.

Let $0\le c &lt; d &lt; e$ be fixed natural numbers and consider a graph on $2e$ vertices, with the vertices labelled as $0,1,\cdots 2e-1$. For every vertex $u$, whenever $u+x-y$ and $u+z-y$ make sense as a vertex and $x,y,z$ are such that $\{x,y,z\}=\{c,d,e\}$, there is a hyperedge $\{u,u+x-y,u+z-y\}$. Is this graph $2$-colorable? If so, how can I construct a $2$-coloring?

I'll be grateful for any suggestions or comments.
",Shahab,https://mathoverflow.net/users/14875,"As far as I understand, your hyperedges are of the form $\{v+c,v+d,v+e\}$ for all suitable $v$. Hence you can just color the vertices from the left to the right. Color the vertices $u\leq e-c-1$ as you wish; then, when you consider some further vertex $u\geq e-c$, there is exactly one edge with the maximal element $u$; so you can color $u$ so that this edge is multichromatic. Proceeding in this way, you will finish with no troubles; each edge was considered on some step, so it is not monochromatic.

Surely this works for any bound instead of $2e-1$.

EDIT. Even simpler: just erase $v+d$ from each edge $\{v+c,v+d,v+e\}$. The remaining graph is obviously bipartite.

3229,Prefer Straight Routes for wayfinding?,"Is there a way to prefer straight roads in network analyst rather than going through zigzag routes (i.e creating straight forward routing instead of really going through the shortest path)?  

I am creating a wayfinding map and want to keep directions straight.



In this example, I want to go from point 1 to point 2 but I don't want to route through the diagonal road(cross). I am not allowed to manipulate time on the network and I cannot block the diagonal road. I prefer to use the other road (with more vertices and longer) is there a way to do this? 
",Mo Ask,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/37221,"The way that I would try to answer your original question is to add a field to your roads and update it with a count of vertices.


Add a Long Integer field
Calculate that field using the Python parser to be equal to !shape.pointcount!,


You can then use the vertex count field as, or to contribute to, your impedance field.

You'll need to think about whether an almost straight road with lots of vertices should be treated as ""straight"" for your purposes, and maybe also about how you will deal with roads that consist of many lines.

@user30184 has offered some very useful advice as a comment that I will append here:


  Probably it would be best to clean the roads from unnecessary dense
  vertices by simplifying. Alternatively you can think about other
  measures like a ratio of mathematical distance from the start node to
  end node vs. the length along the road or something like that.

I'm testing a base dao class which has generic methods for saving, querying, etc.. (not it's not homework).  I'm using an embedded derby connection with hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop for testing purposes.

EDIT:  Fixing cascadeType.  Still the same behavior.  Even if i add in all the available cascade types from the CascadeType enum, it still fails, unless I put CascadeType.ALL.  Not sure what ALL has that you can't specifically enumerate.

In my tests, I have following mapped classes:

@Entity
@Table(name=""FOO_CHILD"")
public class FooChild {
    @Id
    @Column(name=""FOO_ID"")
    private Long id;

    @Column(name=""NAME"")
    private String name;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

@Entity
@Table(name=""FOO_PARENT"")

    @Id

    @Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)
    @Type(type=""long"")
    @OneToMany(cascade={CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE})
    @JoinTable(name=""FOO_PARENT_FOO"",
            joinColumns={@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName=""FOO_PARENT_ID"")},
            inverseJoinColumns={@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName=""FOO_ID"")})
    private List&lt;Foo&gt; fooChild;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public List&lt;Foo&gt; getFooChild() {
        return fooChild;
    }

    public void setFooChild(List&lt;Foo&gt; fooChild) {
        this.fooChild = fooChild;
    }
}


And then i try to save:

FooChild fooChild = new FooChild();
fooChild.setId(1L);
fooChild.setName(""fooChild"");

FooParent fooParent = new FooParent();
fooParent.setId(1L);
fooParent.setName(""fooParent"");
fooParent.setFooChild(new ArrayList&lt;FooChild&gt;(Arrays.asList(fooChild)));

session.save(fooParent);
session.flush();
session.clear();


I get the following trace:

I noticed the following sql being executed:

    insert 
    into
        foo_parent
        (name, foo_parent_id) 
    values

    insert 
    into
        foo_parent_foo
        (foo_parent, foo_child) 
    values
        (?, ?)


It seems it's trying to insert into the collection before cascading the save down to the FooChild object.

If i change FooParent to have this:

@OneToMany(cascade={CascadeType.ALL})


The problem goes away.

As i said, this works with hibernate 3, so i'm not sure why it's behaving differently.

  For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.


There is so much technology now. 

Does the Catholic Church have a view on whether or not it has to be a literal physical gathering of two or more?
",WelcomeNewUsers,https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/6506,"The Catechism of the Catholic Church lays down some precepts:


  2042 The first precept (“You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation.”) requires the faithful to participate in the Eucharistic celebration when the Christian community gathers together on the day commemorating the Resurrection of the Lord.82
  
  82 Canons 1246&ndash;1248


Note the use of the words participate, community, gather together. The use of this language precludes the solitary &ldquo;participation&rdquo; of viewing from afar. That&rsquo;s not gathering in community.

Pope Francis mentions this in Evangelii Gaudium:


  87. Today, when the networks and means of human communication have made unprecedented advances, we sense the challenge of finding and sharing a “mystique” of living together, of mingling and encounter, of embracing and supporting one another ... To go out of ourselves and to join others is healthy for us. To be self-enclosed is to taste the bitter poison of immanence, and humanity will be worse for every selfish choice we make.


To answer the inevitable supplementary question, &ldquo;What about two or three people gathered around a screen?&rdquo;, it is only necessary to say that they are not participating in what they are watching. It is still a vicarious experience. 

This precept doesn&rsquo;t mean that attending a church service, having to stand outside and watching what is happening inside is not participating, particularly when those inside involve those outside, for example by administering communion to them. That&rsquo;s participation because there is community; a gathering together; mingling and encounter; embracing and mutual support.

3532,What to look (out) for when buying a (second-hand) electronic drum kit?,"I'm a beginner drummer (only had 4 lessons so far) and I am thinking about buying an electronic drum kit. I've read this post and this post on buying a beginner drum kit, but both seem to be almost entirely about buying an acoustic kit.


What are the differences when buying a beginner electronic drum kit (as opposed to acoustic)?


I'd like the kit to last for a while, so


How long will a beginner kit suffice, or do you outgrow it quickly? Is there a big difference between beginner, intermediate or pro electronic kits when it comes to sound quality?


Finally, one of my options is to buy a second-hand kit, so:


What are the things I should be looking for or avoid when checking out a second-hand electronic kit? 


I hope these aren't too many questions. I'm willing to spread them over multiple questions if that's better. 

I'm not sure if it matters, but my budget is somewhere around 500-900 euro's (that's $660-$1200) and I'm hoping I can use the drum kit for both practicing and playing a few easy songs in my hobby band (perhaps even at a gig).
",THelper,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/1881,"This Really Depends on the quality of the electronic drum kit your are buying, the thing you should look out for the most is how responsive the heads and cymbals are. I've plaid some shoddy electric kits in my time where it is delayed from the time you hit the pad to the sound playing it is very minute, the timing delay but for a drummer, the timing needs to be perfect or you risk going out of time with the song and so forth when in practice. Also there are naturally things an acoustic kit can do that an electric kit cant, like choking cymbals and performing rim hits. 

The most obvious of differences between Acoustic and electric is the time in which it takes to set up as well as the space in which it takes up. also you wont annoy your neighbours quite as much with electric. But you get a much more authentic and better quality sound from acoustic. the maintenance of an acoustic set requires ALOT more attention. But the cost of electricity is increased with electric. Overall Acoustic is a lot more expensive. the sticks wont degrade half as quickly with electric sets and the heads arguably last longer than the skins for acoustic heads.

If you are buying second hand check the quality of the wires as they can stop the drums working completely. each head has a separate wire. Also pay very close attention to the sensitivity of the foot pedals I once tested a kit that doubled and even tripled up strokes on the hi hit foot pedal so when I pressed the pedal once it hit twice and three times and wouldn't clamp down as a closed hi hat. the springs also in the foot pedals need to be checked for rust and so on. Do not be fobbed off with faulty equipment, test it fully before buying it. things are easily covered up with electric drum kits in my opinion.

I am editing as things spring to my mind here  but also do not leave either kit (Acoustic or Electric) in damp areas, it can take no time at all in killing either. the wires and electronics are a lot more susceptible to damage than on a good hardy shell of an acoustic with its metal stands and clamps but springs in the adjusters of the acoustic kit can also rust making it a pain to adjust them. plastic makes the electric kit easier to adjust and set up.

I've considered writing my own serializer/deserializer, but would prefer native browser capabilities.

Is there a way to use postMessage like a serializer, without having to worry about eavesdropping?

NOTE: I don't care about eavesdropping using dev tools. My app is loading plugin like modules and I want to make sure those aren't able to eavesdrop on messages that are for other modules.
",Marcus Stade,https://stackoverflow.com/users/68909,"DOM events level 2 can be canceled by any event handler that calls the stopPropagation method of the event object it's handling. If you make sure that your event handler is the first one on the page (essentially by making sure that your script tags are the first ones on the page) then you can call stopPropagation to prevent other code from eavesdropping on your messages. You may also do this on a selective basis to make sure that only your events are filtered out.

So essentially you'll be doing this:

window.addEventListener(""message"", function (event) {
    var data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (data.secret === ""my event and not anyone else's"") {
        // do something

3671,Regularity assumption in the simple trace formula,"In the simple trace formula of Deligne Kazhdan one assumes that the test function is supported at the elliptic regular elements at one place and is a supercusp form at another place.  Why can't one just assume that it is supported on elliptic elements (not necessarily regular)?

More specifically, I don't see how the regularity assumption is used in the proofs of the simple trace formula.  I understand that one can get around it using Arthur's work.  
",jaycegetz,https://mathoverflow.net/users/50886,"If you don't make that assumption, you also will get ""one-dimensional"" representations. For example, consider $G=GL(2)$ and $F$ global function field, assume at two place pseudo matrix coefficient for the Steinberg representation and let the remaining local test functions be the characteristic function of $F_v^\times GL_2(o_v)$. This gives you then $(-1)^2$ for the the trivial representation. The trace formula is still called simple then (see Gelbart-Jacquet), not really more complicated than the one of Flicker-Kazdhan, but you get for each automorphic 1-dim'l representation $\mu \circ \det$ for $\mu^2 =\chi$ one extra contribution.

This solution is not very object oriented. That may be okay if you are a beginner, but if you know how to initialize objects, you should use that knowledge.
Method names should be lowercase
the Random object should be reused, make it a static member
don't write int r, c; at the beginning of the method, just initialize the vars in the loop: for(int c=...
learn to use the ternary operator, e.g. map[r][c] = (num &gt; threshold) ? 9 : 0;


And last but not least a common trick for board games: Surround your board with an invisible border of one field (e.g. your 10x10 field would become internally 12x12), which are empty. Don't show them, don't allow the user to access them. Then, if you check the neighborhood of a field for mines, you don't have to check if you are off-limits because you have that safety border, and because these fields are always empty, your count is still correct.

As a starting point, here is how I would start (without any user interaction or game loop, but with calculation and display done):

Note that for a real world application this approach is still not ""OO"" enough, as there is a tight coupling between the model and the user interface. Ideally you would factor out all user interactions in a separate class, which would simplify later refactoring (e.g. using Swing instead console). However, I felt that for that small example this would be probably overkill.

So, since I spoke to him and showed him what all of you said, he said that the equation was actually (0!+0!+0!)!=6, which means that what was written on the piece of paper that he had given me was written in error.

3901,How to generate smooth contours from cropped raster?,"I’m trying to create contours from a raster layer in QGIS. On my first attempt, I cropped my raster layer in Photoshop and reimported it, but it lost coordinate data I think. I made the contours successfully and they were beautiful, but mirrored upwards from the raster layer.

The scale is way out. I discovered this when I imported some vector data. A distance that should be 0.04 degrees is now 30 degrees. This probably is why I’m having my next problem:

I eventually figured out a method for cropping the raster layer in QGIS so it’s at the right scale and location. However, when I make contours from this raster they appear square and pixellated, like they follow the pixel boundaries of the raster layer.

The pixel data for the two raters I used looks the same, so why is this one at the smaller scale now looking so different? Any idea how I can get the nice smooth contours that I got on my first attempt (albeit at the wrong scale)?

I’m very new to this, so I may be missing obvious things! I’d appreciate any help.
",Graham vdR,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/7364,"This answer summarizes the comments above, where the solution was discovered.

The problem turned out to be that during the cropping process on the raster, the cell size was increased dramatically.  When the contour operation was run, it created very angular and pixellated lines.  

I suggested:


  It would also be a good idea to check and make sure that the cell size
  and other factors did not change during the cropping process. If the
  cell size increased significantly from the original, that could make
  the resulting contours very angular instead of having smooth curves.


Here is how @GrahamvdR found the problem:


  Ah, @GetSpatial, if I look at the metadata for the two raster layers I
  see the Pixel Size has increased hugely (though visually I see no
  difference). Any ideas on how to avoid this?


Here is the solution as described by @GrahamvdR:


  OK, problem solved! I used Raster > Extraction > Clipper to make the
  crop and the contours I generated subsequently are perfect. Obviously
  the method I had tried for cropping was not ideal.

3941,How do I make files copied over the network from my Windows computer be owned by me?,"I have a drive on my Ubuntu machine shared over a network, and one of the computers that can access it is a Windows 7 computer.

Whenever I am on my Windows computer and I copy a file to the Ubuntu shared folder, it appears as owned by nobody, and with limited permissions:

I always have to go to the command line on the Ubuntu side and issue a chown command to make it so that I have permissions to edit the file. Until I do, I can't move or copy it, and it won't sync with Dropbox.

How can I make it so that when I copy files from my Windows machine they automatically are owned by me (I only have one user account on my Ubuntu machine) and I have the permission to edit and move them freely?
",Questioner,https://askubuntu.com/users/17041,"I think the problem is related to the Ubuntu side cause the shared directory doesn't have enough permission.

Since any files which is created in the directory has parent-child relation permission feature So it's a good chance to change umask of the directory.

Due to the wikipedia, 


  In computing, umask is a command that determines the settings of a
  mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created
  files


So I think changing the umask of the directory may has worth of testing.

To archive changing of umask,there are a lot of documentations and examples in the network.

You can't cast a struct thread_data * to a struct thread_data, neither can you assign a struct thread_data to a struct thread_data *. The incorrect and unnecessary cast is the sole cause of the error.

x = pthread_create(&amp;threads[id], NULL, &amp;countFrequency, (void *)data); /* wrong */


Secondly, nor can you cast a struct thread_data to a void * - you need an actual pointer, like the address of data:

x = pthread_create(&amp;threads[id], NULL, &amp;countFrequency, &amp;data);


No cast, either, because pointers to data types convert to void * naturally. Of course, since there's only one copy of data all the threads are going to share it, and all work on whatever the last values written to it were. That's not going to go well - you'll want one struct thread_data per thread.

Thirdly, those warnings are telling you your thread function has the wrong signature:

void *countFrequency(struct thread_data *data) /* wrong */


Combined with the first point, get all the types correct and yet again no casts are needed.

void *countFrequency(void *data) {

Now, I would like this map to be entirely usable, once printed, for navigating the city. In Google Maps, all the necessary street names are available, however, if I zoom out far enough to see the whole city, only major streets are marked with their names.

So my question is, is there a way to display a KML file on Google Maps, with a larger map, but at a specific zoom level (the zoom level that displays the necessary street names)?

Replace http://maps.google.com/maps in the code above with the URL generated in Google Maps when you click the link icon, and then inside Paste HTML to embed in website. Don't copy the entire &lt;iframe ... code, just the src of the generated iframe tag.

This will create a 4000px by 4000px map. Change the width and height parameters above if that's not big enough (or too big). If your browser tries to paginate the map rather than resize it down to one page, try using a screen-capture browser extension to save a screengrab of the entire 4000x4000 page as an image, then print the image file.

A caveat, though: printing a 4000x4000 map on letter paper will produce street names that are far too small to read. In general Google's labels are sized appropriately for the zoom size, which more or less correlates with printing at that size/zoom. To print a larger (in width/height, not zoom level) map and still be able to read the labels, you'll need to print on large paper like a poster.

That having been said; We can take a look at Scripture to see what they have to say regarding this.


  Matthew 22:37 through 40  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38  This is the first and great commandment. 39  And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. 


What Jesus appears to be pointing out here is that if you do not do these two things, then it will be almost impossible to keep the rest of the Law.

So Let's see what other Scriptures may help in understanding this; although many questions that arise in life are not directly addressed in Scriptures we are given clues as to how to handle them.


  Matthew 5:21 and 22  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: 22  But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
  
  Matthew 5:27 and 28  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28  But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 


From these two Scriptures Jesus is teaching us two things:


It is our precepts that determine our compliance with the Commandments, and not our actions, as is expressed in the fact that although we may not actually kill someone, it is the desire to do so that is not in compliance. After all how can you love your neighbor as yourself if stay mad at him, and especially if it is only you who have perceived wrong doing by him.
If we desire to do wrong it is tantamount to having done it. Even though we may contemplate stealing someone else's wealth for our own use, we have in effect not only put our greed above the other person's welfare; but we have denied God's promise to supply all of our needs as Jesus explained in his sermon on the Mount.



  Mat 5:3 through 11  Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4  Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5  Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7  Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8  Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9  Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10  Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11  Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 


Jesus is here saying that God will provide all of our heart's desires as long as those desires are in keeping with serving him. And:


  Matthew 6:8  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 


If there is one common concept in these Scriptures it is that God knows and considers our intents and our innermost desires. And that it is those upon which compliance with the Commandments is judged. And because Jesus has been tempted in every way in which we can be tempted which would have to include disobedience of every one of the Commandments, he alone is qualified to judge.

So let's take a look at  Chapter 14 of Romans and see if we can more discern what Paul is conveying. 

Let's take a look at this excerpt from John Gill's commentary of the whole Bible.


  for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. This is a general rule, or axiom, which is not only applicable to the present case, but to any other, whether of a natural, civil, moral, or evangelic kind: ""whatsoever does not spring from faith"", as the Arabic version renders it, cannot be excused of sin; whatever is not agreeable to the word and doctrine of faith, ought not to be done; whatever is done without faith, or not in the exercise of it, is culpable, for without faith nothing can be pleasing to God; and whatever is contrary to the persuasion of a man's own mind, is so far criminal, as it is a violation of his conscience; whatever men do, especially in a religious way, they ought to make faith of it, or to be fully persuaded of it in their own minds, or they act amiss: 


It appears from this commentary that our purpose for anything we do should be based in our desire to please God, which is an integral part of Worship so it is up to you to decide whether or not mental disobedience of the command to have no other gods before me; is or is not is included. For my part I am inclined to believe it is based on the Scriptures I have quoted.

Hope this helps.

There’s a collection called “Photos Adjusted in iPhoto”, but I’m not convinced that even the photos in here reflect the adjustments I made in iPhoto.

I would have expected each edited photo to have been imported in its original form and then had an “Edited in iPhoto” entry added in the History to reflect all of the iPhoto changes.

If you analyse the counter and delItemCol.Count.

        counter      delItemCol.Count

If it is 0.75 (or even better if it is less than 0.8 in case image is little cropped) than to return ""Portrait image"".

Here is the picture of Niagara Falls frozen in 1933 (in the very cold winter).


Here is the picture of Niagara Falls frozen in 1911 (in the extremely cold winter).


Background knowledge: The Melting/Freezing point of the static water at 1 atm is 32°F (0.0°C or 273.15 K).

$\bullet$ I am curious to know under what conditions of the air pressure(atm), temperature, solute density in the water would cause the Niagara fall frozen?

Are other conditions like: winds, snowing or not, the strength of Van der Waals force, the moving speed/velocity of water and the pulling force of gravity (acceleration $g$), the height $H$ of waterfalls would be some important factors to predict the conditions to freeze the waterfalls?

Is there some simple qualitative relations or quantitative formulas describing the freezing point for waterfall? A $P$(pressure),$T$(temperature), etc, $\dots$ curve for the water-ice phase transition on the phase diagram? Perhaps the answer is very simple(?), but it is not entirely trivial to me.

",wonderich,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/12813,"
  I am curious to know under what conditions of the air pressure(atm), temperature, solute density in the water would cause the Niagara fall frozen?


In general, the answer is ""a bit lower than 32 Fahrenheit"". Here's two things which one might think would come into play, but actually do not to an appreciable extend.


Solute concentation


The major solutes which are present in the Great Lakes are sodium, chloride, and a host of other ions in lesser amounts. According to the government website here, the typical sodium concentration found in the Great Lakes is on the order of 10 mg/L. This is well within the regime of ideal solution behavior, and so we get a freezing point depression of $\Delta T\approx k_fbi=0.0016$ Kelvin (assuming NaCl). This is tiny compared to seasonal temperature variations, so solute concentration can be mostly ignored.


Air pressure


Air pressure is also almost completely negligible, for two reasons. One is that the pressure variation through the water depth of the water is much greater than typical atmospheric pressure variations; for example, atmospheric pressure ranges from 29.5 to 30.5 inHg, which is comparable to the pressure variation in a foot of water (and the river is considerably deeper than one foot at most places). Two is that even accounting for pressure variations of both the atmosphere and within the water itself, the linearized Clausius-Clapeyron relation predicts a negligible temperature dependence. For example, for the water-ice phase transition we obtain
$$\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta P}=\frac{T\Delta v}{L}=0.00025\mbox{K/inHg}$$
which means that seasonal or daily variations in atmospheric pressure will only change the freezing point by something on the order of milliKelvin. Thus atmospheric pressure variation, and most likely water-depth variations in pressure, are negligible compared to seasonal variations in temperature.


Stuff this leaves out


This obviously leaves out a lot of kinetic and rate information. For example, dissipative heating at the foot of the waterfall will heat up the water there by approximately
$$\Delta T=\frac{mgh}{C_p}=0.12\mbox{K}$$
which easily swamps the contribution due to air pressure and solute concentration. This also ignores nucleation effects, and it ignores the rates of coolings from evaporative cooling and air cooling, so it says nothing about how long one would have to wait for the entire waterfall to freeze in so-and-so temperature. However, I think it's safe to say that the temperature needs to be a good bit lower than 32F for the falls to freeze. It may also be worthwhile to look through historical archives and see what the mean temperature was in the years for the photographs you posted.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by Van der Waals force, as that's pretty much going to be constant within a given substance.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G#


If you were to build chords from each note you would have the following chords: 


Am      - (A,C,E)
Bdim    - (B,D,F)
C+      - (C,E,G#)
Dm      - (D,F,A)
E       - (E,G#,B)
F       - (F,A,C)
G#dim   - (G#,B,D)


In A melodic minor (ascending) you have the following notes:


A, B, C, D, E, F#, G#


If you were to build chords from each note you would have the following chords: 


Am     - (A,C,E)
Bm     - (B,D,F#)

D      - (D,F#,A)
E      - (E,G#,B)
F#dim  - (F#,A,C)
G#dim  - (G#,B,D)


As you can see there is a very simple method to building chords that you can apply to any scale.

4416,Area precipitation using IDW,"I'm having the following problem with IDW automation. I have a catchment and several gauging stations measuring daily precipitation amounts. I would like to interpolate the precipitation amounts from these stations (points) to the whole catchment. In the next step, I would like to calculate average precipitation value for the catchment. I can do it for one day (1 value for each station).
The problem is that I have 30 years of daily precipitation measurements in each station, and so I need to do this process thousands of times. I have created a simple model in model builder which could do this process once, but I am not able to force it to do it repeatedly.

I need help how to automate this process.

Thanks

Here is the modelbuilder scheme:

",user21816,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/21816,"There exists an extremely efficient solution to this problem that avoids computing ten thousand grids of interpolated data.



Using IDW to estimate precipitation tends to give poor results, so I will provide a more general answer that applies to better procedures such as Kriging as well as IDW.

What is common to these interpolation procedures is that they are linear preditors.  This means that the value Z'(x,y) they predict at a given location (x,y) is a linear combination of the values Z(1), Z(2), ..., Z(n) at the monitoring stations and the weights in that linear combination are determined solely from the n locations and (x,y) (and do not depend on the observations).  If we write these weights as w(i), i=1, ..., n, then explicitly

Z'(x,y) = w(1)*Z(1) + w(2)*Z(2) + ... + w(n)*Z(n)


and each w(i) is a function of the locations (x,y), (x(1),y(1)), ..., (x(n),y(n)).

As an example, the IDW-p weights are

w(i) = d(i)^(-p) / [d(1)^(-p) + ... + d(n)^(-p)]


where d(i) are the distances from (x,y) to (x(i),y(i)) (and typically p = 2).  (It turns out you won't even need to know this formula, which is good because analogous formulas for better linear interpolators, such as various Kriging interpolators, are much more complicated!)

Consider, now, the problem of finding the average within a catchment (or any other predefined fixed region).  Let's call the region R.  This average will be found by predicting Z(x,y) separately for each grid cell within the region and averaging those predictions.  Let the cell centers have coordinates (u(1),v(1)), ..., (u(m),v(m)) where m is the number of cells in the region.  The average Z'(R) is defined to be

Z'(R) = [Z'(u(1),v(1)) + Z'(u(2),v(2)) + ... + Z'(u(m),v(m))] / m


This, too, is a linear combination of the observations.  Write w(i,j) for the weight applied to Z(i) when computing Z'(u(j),v(j)).  Then the weight applied to Z(i) in the average is seen algebraically to equal

w'(i) = [w(i,1) + w(i,2) + ... + w(i,m)] / m


That is, it's just the average weight within the region.

Now suppose the stations obtain repeated observations synchronously over time.  Let's introduce time explicitly into the notation by writing Z(i,t) for the observation at station i at time t.  Because the stations do not move and the same fixed grid is used to represent the regions, none of the weights change over time.  Therefore the catchment average at each time t is still obtained with the same linear combination w'(1)*Z(1,t) + ... + w'(n)*Z(n,t). If we would like to average these over a period spanning observation times t(1), t(2), ..., t(s), then the average algebraically works out to

w'(1)*Z'(1) + ... + w'(n)*Z'(n)


where Z'(i) is the time average at station i,

Z'(i) = [Z(i,t(1)) + Z(i,t(2)) + ... + Z(i,t(s))] / s.


Therefore

The average in each catchment is obtained as a suitable weighted linear combination of the averages at each station

and

The weights depend only on the locations of the stations and the set of grid cells used to represent the catchment.

All we have to do is find these n weights and the rest is easy!  This analysis has collapsed the calculation of 30*365 grids (of perhaps millions of points each) into the calculation of n weights, which is a huge reduction in effort (because it's almost always the case that the number of grid cells used to represent a region greatly exceeds the number of monitoring stations).

As we have seen, the final weights ultimately derive from a grid of weights, one per grid cell, computed for each monitoring station.  These are the weights associated with station i at each cell center (u(j),v(j)).  Here's the punch line: you can find all these weights with just n simple calculations.  Artificially set the value at station i to 1 and set all the other values to 0.  Run your interpolation routine (IDW or Kriging or whatever) on these synthetic data.  As we have seen, the interpolated value at (u(j),v(j)) is

w(1,j)*Z(1) + w(2,j)*Z(2) + ... + w(n,j)*Z(n)
= w(1,j)*0 + ... + w(i-1,j)*0 + w(i,j)*1 + w(i+1,j)*0 + ... + w(n,j)*0
= w(i,j).


You just read the weights right off the grid!  This leads the the following simple recipe:


For i = 1 to n, do the following:


Set Z(i) = 1 and Z(k) = 0 for k &lt;> i.  
Run the interpolation routine, creating a grid of the weights w(i,j) (where j indexes the grid cells).

Average the w(i,j) within each catchment.  (This is a zonal mean calculation, one for each station i.)  This produces a collection of weights w(i,R) where i ranges over the stations and R ranges over the catchments.
Average the observations at each station, producing Z'(i) for each i.
The time average in catchment R is the linear combination w(1,R)*Z'(1) + ... + w(n,R)*Z'(n).


Total effort: n interpolations, n zonal means, n time-averages of the observations, and one linear combination for each region.



Things get complicated when some of the monitoring stations are missing data.  The same principles and analysis apply, but different sets of weights have to be computed for different groupings of active stations.  This, properly speaking, is actually a problem of statistical imputation and perhaps is better handled using more sophisticated imputation procedures, including those that capitalize on the spatial and temporal correlations that are surely present in the data (using methods of geostatistics and time series analysis).

",Saif Bechan,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/8384,"Instead of writing comments, I would avoid using anonymous functions or meaningless names.

For instance,

var create = function (socket, signature) {
    var e = event('create', signature), data = [];
    socket.emit(e, {id : 1});
};


What do you create ? Looking at the code you create an event and then you emit it.

var createAndEmitEvent = function (socket, signature) {
    var e = event('create', signature), data = [];
    socket.emit(e, {id : 1});
};


Here you know by its name. Therefor you don't need a comment block. This block code block doesn't respect the single responsibility principle but principles are meant to be broken. A 2 lines function doesn't need to be splitted.

I would also allow some duplication in the signature.

var createAndEmitEvent = function createAndEmitEvent (socket, signature) { 


The purpose of this is to have the name of the function in the stack trace in case of an error. Otherwise, the function will be identified as anonymous.

Here's another example.

socket.on('init', function(data){
    if(hs.session.userdata){
        fs.readFile(__dirname + '/assets/tmpl/user/dashboard.html', 'utf8', function(err, html){

            socket.emit('init', {callback: 'login', tmpl: html});
        });
    }
});


You could create a function called onInitSocket. You also have a another callback inside this function to handle the readFile callback. This is a smell. You could handle this case using promise or using the async module. I recommend the latest in your case in order to not change the paradigm. You also have a variable called hs. If you split your code in functions and later in different file, it won't be so obvious that this name refers to handshake.

Overall, make sure your code speak for itself. You should only have to use comments when the code needs to be unclear (algorithme optimization for instance).

Postgres works very well on a workstation - it also works very well on the server. 

You should be aware that Postgres, being a full blown server DBMS does require some kind of installation - and it requires to start the server process in order to use it. You don't really need a Windows service and you can start and stop the server from within your application (by calling pg_ctl). 

For our development team I have prepared a little batch file that gets a Postgres server up and running from the ZIP distribution without any installation hassles. Something like that should be suitable for your needs as well). If your are interested, I can add it to this answer.

Although I really like Postgres (and would chose it over SQL Server any time), I agree with dezso that an embedded engine like SQLite (or even SQL Server CE) might be more suitable, due to smaller installation requirements (and thus less possible problems). But they are less powerful as well.

4663,How to get an Excel-like surface plot with ListContourPlot3D,"I'm trying to create an Excel like surface plot from an import of data from an Excel workbook.  I get the data without issue.  It is a set of percentages in bin ranges over a series of dates.  I'd like to plot this as a surface.  After some searching it appears that I need to use ListContorPlot3D. 

It seems that I need to transform the data into a list of 3d vectors. I want the dates to show in the plot so I use the DateObject to let the plot know what it is.  However, it wont plot.  It complains that I have not provided a list of points of dimension 3.  But it is a list of points of dimension 3; {Date, Bin, Value}.  

I thought this would be an easy thing to do with the import. What have I done wrong? Am I using the correct plot for this? A sample of the data, the transformation command, and the plot command is below.

Many thanks for your help.

Just input 100 points from your values and you'll probably get something good. You may need more points for it to be accurate at locations of high variance. If you insist on using an evolutionary algorithm, you might use it to choose near-optimal choices of data points, but in many cases you could probably do almost as well by spreading them around evenly.

Two-variable interpolation isn't on Wikipedia. But it is Google-able, and I found it described in sufficient generality in section 3 of this paper.

Thank you.
",Belmin Bedak,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/58239,"This is going to be a ton of code and a ton of explanation. Most of which can be copy and paste but I suggest taking the time to understand what's going on and why. First thing to understand is that WordPress does not have Taxonomy Metadata but it may someday. This means that we need to save our data as options. Second thing to understand is that we have to deal with multiple hooks:


{$taxonomy}_add_form_fields - The page where we add the terms.
{$taxonomy}_edit_form_fields - Whenever a user clicks the term to edit the slug or description once it's been created.
created_{$taxonomy} - Save the data whenever a taxonomy term is created.
edited_{$taxonomy} - Save the data whenever a taxonomy term is modified / edited.
pre_delete_term - To clean up our data whenever a term is deleted.


Whenever you see {$taxonomy} you would replace it with whatever you taxonomy slug is. In this example I will use the default / built-in Post Categories taxonomy whose slug is category.

The below will not cover adding the fields to Quick Edit or Add New Term Metabox.



Lets start with displaying the textbox to accept classes. Since both pages display their data differently ( and pass separate parameters ) we have to create two separate functions and assign them to {$taxonomy}_add_form_fields and {$taxonomy}_edit_form_fields respectively. Both are commented to point out anything our of the ordinary.

/**
 * Category ""Add New"" Page - Add Additional Field(s)
 * @param string $taxonomy
 */
function category_fields_new( $taxonomy ) {                             // Function has one field to pass - Taxonomy ( Category in this case )
    wp_nonce_field( 'category_meta_new', 'category_meta_new_nonce' );   // Create a Nonce so that we can verify the integrity of our data
?&gt;
    &lt;div class=""form-field""&gt;
        &lt;label for=""category_fa""&gt;Font-Awesome Icon&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input name=""category_icon"" id=""category_fa"" type=""text"" value="""" style=""width:100%"" /&gt;
        &lt;p class=""description""&gt;Enter a custom font-awesome icon - &lt;a href=""http://fontawesome.io/icons/"" target=""_blank""&gt;List of Icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php
}
add_action( 'category_add_form_fields', 'category_fields_new', 10 );

/**
 * Category ""Edit Term"" Page - Add Additional Field(s)
 * @param Object $term
 * @param string $taxonomy
 */
function category_fields_edit( $term, $taxonomy ) {                         // Function has one field to pass - Term ( term object) and Taxonomy ( Category in this case )
    wp_nonce_field( 'category_meta_edit', 'category_meta_edit_nonce' );     // Create a Nonce so that we can verify the integrity of our data
    $category_icon = get_option( ""{$taxonomy}_{$term-&gt;term_id}_icon"" );     // Get the icon if one is set already
?&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""form-field""&gt;
        &lt;th scope=""row"" valign=""top""&gt;
            &lt;label for=""category_fa""&gt;Font-Awesome Icon&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;input name=""category_icon"" id=""category_fa"" type=""text"" value=""&lt;?php echo ( ! empty( $category_icon ) ) ? $category_icon : ''; ?&gt;"" style=""width:100%;"" /&gt; &lt;!-- IF `$category_icon` is not empty, display it. Otherwise display an empty string --&gt;
            &lt;p class=""description""&gt;Enter a custom Font-Awesome icon - &lt;a href=""http://fontawesome.io/icons/"" target=""_blank""&gt;List of Icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php
}
add_action( 'category_edit_form_fields', 'category_fields_edit', 10, 2 );


The next step is to save our options. Since category creation and category edit will be handled the same way when saving, we'll use the same function for both. We still need to use the created_{$taxonomy} and edited_{$taxonomy}. As mentioned toward the top, since Taxonomy Metadata does not exist we have to save our data to the options table which needs a unique name. This is why we give our option a unique name of {$taxonomy}_{$term_id}_icon which, in this example, translates to category_1_icon.

/**
 * Save our Additional Taxonomy Fields
 * @param int $term_id
 */
function save_category_fields( $term_id ) {

    /** Verify we're either on the New Category page or Edit Category page using Nonces **/
    /** Verify that a Taxonomy is set **/
    if( isset( $_POST['taxonomy'] ) &amp;&amp; isset( $_POST['category_icon'] ) &amp;&amp;
        ( 
          isset( $_POST['category_meta_new_nonce'] ) &amp;&amp; wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['category_meta_new_nonce'], 'category_meta_new' ) ||        // Verify our New Term Nonce
          isset( $_POST['category_meta_edit_nonce'] ) &amp;&amp; wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['category_meta_edit_nonce'], 'category_meta_edit' )        // Verify our Edited Term Nonce
        )
    ) {
        $taxonomy = $_POST['taxonomy'];
        $category_icon = get_option( ""{$taxonomy}_{$term_id}_icon"" );   // Grab our icon if one exists

        if( ! empty( $_POST['category_icon'] ) ) {                      // IF the user has entered text, update our field.
            update_option( ""{$taxonomy}_{$term_id}_icon"", htmlspecialchars( sanitize_text_field( $_POST['category_icon'] ) ) );     // Sanitize our data before adding to the database
        } elseif( ! empty( $category_icon ) ) {                         // Category Icon IS empty but the option is set, they may not want an icon on this category
            delete_option( ""{$taxonomy}_{$term_id}_icon"" );             // Delete our option
        }

    } // Nonce Conditional
} // End Function
add_action ( 'created_category', 'save_category_fields' );
add_action ( 'edited_category', 'save_category_fields' );


Finally, we need to clean up our options. Postmeta deletes itself when a post is deleted but Options do not. We need to manually delete these so that our options tables does not get bloated with orphaned options.

/**
 * Essential Cleanup of our Options
 * @param int $term_id
 * @param string $taxonomy
 */
function remove_term_options( $term_id, $taxonomy ) {
    delete_option( ""{$taxonomy}_{$term_id}_icon"" );         // Delete our option
}
add_action( 'pre_delete_term', 'remove_term_options', 10, 2 );




If we want to display each icon that has currently been assigned. Since we're generating a Unique Option Name using the Taxonomy and Term ID we would get the options using that same formula. First let's get our terms, then let's loop through our terms.

$terms = get_terms(            // Returns an array of Term Objects, 
    'category',                 // Pass our Taxonomy
    array(                      // Pass our Arguments
        'hide_empty' =&gt; false   // Show ALL Terms
    )
);

if( ! empty( $terms ) ) {           // Make sure we have some terms to loop through
    foreach( $terms as $term ) {    // Loop through each term
        $icon = get_option( ""{$term-&gt;taxonomy}_{$term-&gt;term_id}_icon"" );    // Use our formula to grab the Icon - This translate to ""category_1_icon""
        echo ""Category {$term-&gt;name} Icon: {$icon}&lt;br /&gt;"";                  // Display our Category Icon
    }
}

4835,Why can't the IV be predictable when its said it doesn't need to be a secret?,"I heard multiple times not to reuse the same IV and IV should be random but doesn't need to be secret. I also heard if the IV is something like sequential numbers or something predictable I should hash(salt+pepper) it. Why on earth should i be doing that if they don't need to be a secret?

In this specific case i am encrypting rows with one secret AES key and i am using a fixed IV but xor-ing it with the row id. Its predictable and not secret but by doing this it isn't reused which i thought was the important part.

Are IVs suppose to be secret? Are predictable IVs ok? Should i be hashing predictable IV?
",acidzombie24,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/2651,"The requirements for an IV depend on which encryption algorithm you are using (AES is not an encryption algorithm by itself, since it can only act on 16-byte strings, but it can be used as a building block in a variety of different encryption schemes), specifically on the mode of operation.

Roughly speaking, the role of the IV is to insert some ""new"" randomness into the process each time a message is encrypted. That way, the same message encrypts to a different ciphertext each time, and similar messages to not result in similar ciphertexts. This is the reason why IVs often need to be random, but never need to be secret.

To answer your questions:

IVs do not need to be secret. In fact, they are often considered part of the ciphertext, and it is assumed that in adversary will see them.

Predictable IVs can sometimes be harmful. If you are using AES inside of Counter mode (CTR) encryption, predictable IVs are fine (the IV acts as a counter that gets incremented with each 16-byte block you encrypt; the important point here is that a counter value should never be repeated). On the other hand, if you are using Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC), a predictable IV can allow some chosen-plaintext attacks. Preventing this is usually considered the ideal goal of an encryption scheme, since it implies the attacker can't do other, more harmful, things. Depending on the specific context, predictable CBC IVs can definitely cause problems.

Hashing doesn't necessarily make IVs more unpredictable. Hashing an otherwise predictable IV can make it look ""more random"", but where are you getting the salt and pepper? If these are also predictable, then hashing hasn't gained you anything. If they are random, then why not use this random number generator to make your IV directly?

You can play it safe by always generating random IVs. This can be ""overkill"" for algorithms such as CTR mode, but it will still be safe.

For more information:


Blockcipher modes of operation (Describes CBC, CTR, and some others)
Initialization vectors


Based on my understanding of what you're doing (I'm not to clear on the details), I'd recommend that whenever you update or create a row, generate a new, random IV for that row, and then use that IV for the encryption. The IV can be concatenated to the ciphertext, or stored in a separate location.

If storing IVs is impractical, a better alternative to hashing would be to use a second key $K$ to generate IVs; for example, the IV for row i could be $\textrm{AES}_K(i)$ or $\textrm{HMAC-SHA256}_K(i)$. The reason for this is that hash functions are not the same thing as pseudo-random functions from a cryptographic perspective, and so hashing something doesn't really give you a random IV. This approach is not secure if you need to update rows (or rather, if an adversary could potentially see two different ciphertexts for the same row), since repeating an IV is bad, bad, bad.

4881,Difference between Hook and function,"I have a confusion regarding the hook and a normal function, So can any one tell me what is the significant difference between a Drupal hook and a normal PHP function in Drupal.  
",madhurjya,https://drupal.stackexchange.com/users/11250,"This is a good question. To clarify it first, Hook is a function. But it is a function that is named in such a way, that other modules and themes can override it with their own versions. 

For example:


Your module 'custom_node' has a function that adds information to
the custom node. That function is called 'custom_node_add_data()'.
Soon after you release the module, you realize, that other people
liked it, and they are asking you to implement a way for them to add
their custom data to a custom node, from their custom modules, so
that they dont have to hack yours.
So what do you do? You make your 'custom_node_add_data()' a hook.
You name it 'hook_add_data()', and then you add your own overrides
in 'custom_node_add_data()'.
Under the hood, Drupal finds the declared hooks, and searched for
functions in all code base that serve the hook formula, where the
'hook' is replaced by the module name.


Thus, profit! Custom modules can now override your hook function with their own code. They 'hook in' to what your module does, because now their hook function will be called.

Hooks allow to replace initial module's functionality with your own functionality in procedural code. In OOP code, like in Drupal 8, hooks are being replaced by subclassing and implementation of interfaces. Some hooks fill still remain in theming.

4901,Is the silencer in the intake path too restrictive on the 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX?,"If you look under the hood of a WRX, the intake path is a little convoluted.  Air enters a large channel near the hood latch that funnels diagonally across the front of the engine compartment.  It then drops down into the fenderwell, passes through a bulbous silencer and then returns via the main intake channel heading towards the manifold.

So, here's the question: is the silencer in the intake path too restrictive for the turbocharged engine?  

You'll often see sites talking about a silencer delete procedure which will definitely make more noise.  What's not at all clear is whether removing any of this piping has any effect on total airflow.

Note: I'm not asking about power, tuning or whether the sound is cool / less so.  The question is whether removing the silencer components will remove a restriction and increase net airflow.
",Bob Cross,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/57,"Simple answer that all the forums seem to agree on, and that my garage also approves is that you will get better airflow to the manifold, however unless you also adjust your ECU, and potentially replace your Mass Airflow Sensor (depending on exactly what you are changing in the airflow path) then you may have problems.

I had the full Prodrive Performance Pack added to one of my Imprezas, and the derestricting the inlet was only required for one of the performance boosts for the turbo. Without the PPP, this derestriction would not have given me any significant difference.

5076,Does the strength of a smell depend on the volume or surface area of an agglomerate of material?,"I just switched from Timberland to Adidas shoes, and noticed a horrible trait of the Adidas tread: instead of being composed of externally-protruding bumps like the Timberland, it is composed of channels striated internally. This has the horrible trait of trapping and making difficult to remove small pebbles, mud, and other foreign objects that one might inadvertently step on.

Assuming that one were to step on an unusually aromatic organic viscoplastic, would the 'strength' of the smell depend on the surface area of the exposed agglomerate, or of its mass? My instinct leads me to think that the surface area would be the major factor, but empirically I see that larger massed agglomerates, even if wedged deep within an Adidas tread with little exposed surface area, seem to be more easily detected by human olfactory organs. However I contend that my sensing apparatus and testng methodology are not scientifically sound, nor do I have access to facilities which would allow me to make more objective observations.

5091,Motorised blind controller schematic - do I need to protect ICs with resistors?,"I am making a simple motorised blind controller, which I want to have a ""safety cut out"" when it gets to its fully closed/fully open state. (So the user doesn't strain the motor keeping their finger on the button when it is open/closed.)

I'm a bit of a noob, but it seemed fairly straightforward in terms of logic. 

Basically there will be a reflective IR sensor at the top, and at the bottom (level with the fully closed position of the blind). The logic is that when the user presses the up button, if the top sensor is high (i.e. the blind is in front of it) the motor will run until either they let go of the button or the sensor goes low (because the blind has passed it).

Similarly, if they press the down button, the motor will run in the opposite direction (controlled by an L293D chip) if the bottom sensor is low (i.e. not covered by the blind). Again this continues until the sensor goes low (blind has reached the bottom) or they let go of the button.

I've drawn up a schematic, and I think the logic is right, but I wanted to check if I need to protect the chips with resistors. I'll power it with a 5V 700mA mobile phone charger for the 5V supply, and I'll also need a separate 12V supply for the motor. (Will join the grounds from both).

Is there anything else I am missing, or any noob gotchas I need to be aware of?

Also - if I have made any howlers on the schematic layout / broken any major conventions, please feel free to put me straight! (Can't figure out how to attach a clearer version as it looks like it has been scaled down to fit.)
",Ben,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/6603,"Are the reflective sensors the only components missing from this schematic? 

What are the reflective sensors? 
Do they provide a digital output, or are they ordinary analogue parts? If they are analogue, and there are no other parts, then there are some issues.

I assume this is for window blinds, in which case, it needs to deal with the possibility of the sensors being blinded or confused by sun-light.

I'd expect to see something controlling the emitter current, to modulate the reflective sensors light source to avoid 'sun' problems. Some sensors might do that internally, but it would help us t see the part number for that sensor.

How is the reflective sensor signal derived? For an analogue sensor, I'd expect to see a resistor, or something so that the sensor can provide a voltage dependent on the intensity of light.

I'd concerned about switching logic gates with an analogue signal. I'd have expected Schmitt triggers to convert the analogue voltage to a logic level.

Edit:
I would expect to see pull-up or pull-down resistors connected to the switches.

When switches are open-circuit, they have no defined voltage on one of the pins. That voltage could be set by static, or radio reception. The inputs for many modern CMOS chips requires a very, very small current. So they could be switched by that 'stray' current.

Normally, the connection to the switch which is going to change (when the switch is pressed) has a pull-up resistor connecting it to V+, or pull-down resistor connecting it to ground. That resistor pulls the state of that connection to a known 'default' value, and hence prevents 'stray' electricity accidentally triggering the circuit. When the switch is pressed, the short circuit 'beats' the resistor and defines the voltage on that connection.

Edit: This issue is not about debouncing. The circuit might work okay even if the switches did 'bounce'. The issue is having connections from open switches with no defined voltage value. Every single throw switch must have a pull-up or pull-down resistor, to reliably define the voltage on the open-circuit wire. I might debounce the switch too.

I'd expect to see some decoupling capacitors across all of the ICs. When an IC switches, it will require a 'pulse' of current. That pulse could cause a glitch in other chips using the same power supply. To ensure stability across the whole circuit, that pulse is supplied by a small capacitor connected very close to each chip.

Edit: What is a decoupling capacitor and how do I know if I need one? looks like it covers all the bases.

I'd like to see some capacitance across the power supply input.

I'd be tempted to use one power source (e.g. 12V) for the entire circuit, and use a voltage regulator to step down to 5V. The chips only under a few 10's of mA on the logic 5V supply, so using an appropriate linear regulator should be okay.

",Julian David Gómez Ríos,https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/12579,"To increase your code coverage, find out the lines that are not being covered using the dev console.

Once you have an Idea of the lines not covered, create scenarios in you test methods that will satisfy the criteria of the lines not covered.

You may have to write separate methods to cover these specific scenerios.

In addition, 100% coverage all the time is an unrealistic goal. Properly asserting your business processes and expected results along with any negative test case should routinely yield 90%+ coverage which is more than adequate. It is not about the percentage anyway it is about the amount of the business process and asserting results that you cover that is important.

5141,MS-SIPAE <-> SSPI: MakeSignature is 'GSS_GetMIC’?,"I have the following question about  Windows SSPI. I have made an Win32 app that has to authorize with a  server: using protocol MS-SIPAE in NTLM mode. The app uses SSPI. 
See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc431510.aspx. about the MS-SIPAE.  There is the following step there (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd946897.aspx): “The protocol client uses an authentication protocol GSS_GetMIC() call, as specified in [MS-NLMP] section 3.1.4 for NTLM, and in [RFC2743] section 2.3.1 for Kerberos, to generate a signature token for the buffer constructed in the preceding step 2 using the authentication protocol context stored in the SA. ”

The question is: what exactly corresponds to the  abstract “GSS_GetMIC” in SSPI API? In SSPI I have found a function named MakeSignature – seems this is what I need. Also an MSDN article http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995331.aspx seems to confirm this. Can someone confirm this conclusion (I do not want rely on the ‘seems’ )?

5253,Accelerating towards the center of your orbit,"If you are in a perfectly circular orbit and accelerate perpendicular to your velocity (directly towards the center of the orbit), what would happen to your orbit? Would it just shift in the direction of acceleration?

Is there a different result if the orbit is not perfectly round?

The basis for this question comes from me playing Kerbal Space Program.  I never really considered orbital mechanics before.
",Tyler DeWitt,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/29540,"This answer assumes the mass of the orbiting body is much smaller than the object being orbited. This is quite valid for artificial satellites around Earth.

If the original orbit is circular with radius $R$, then doing what you describe would cause the new orbit to be elliptical (non-circular) with semi-major axis $a=R$.

Let's say the force is applied over a relatively short time period to make things easier to visualize. The force is perpendicular to the motion, so no work is done on the object+planet system. This means the total energy $E=-GMm/(2R) &lt; 0$ of the system doesn't change.

Now, since the applied force changes the velocity of the orbiting body, but can't change the total energy of the system, then we're left concluding that the orbit is now non-circular with the same energy $E=-GMm/(2R)$. Elliptical orbits are the only other allowed orbital shapes with negative energy, so the orbit is elliptical.

The more general expression for the energy in elliptical orbits is $E=-GMm/(2a)$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis length. This implies an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a=R$ since the energy didn't change.

When I say elliptical, I mean a bound orbit with eccentricity between 0 and 1. That is, non-circular and non-parabolic.

5367,Locating a node in a CompilationUnitSyntax AND SemanticModel,"When working with Roslyn, I will often have a node that is in the CompilationUnitSyntax but not the SemanticModel or vice-versa.  (Or I can only pull the nodes out with operations of one or the other--For example if you need type info from a semantic model, the node querying on has to exist in the SemanticModel's tree)

I can see why they did it for immutability and all that, but how the heck do you consistently go back and find the same token from one tree to another??  If you modify either tree, you have to retrieve the node you were working with somehow.  What's the best way to do it????
",Brian Rosamilia,https://stackoverflow.com/users/160529,"If you want to keep track of a single syntax node while you're changing the tree, you can use SyntaxAnnotation.

To use it, create a new SyntaxAnnotation (or a custom derived type, if you need to keep some additional information with that annotation) and then add it to a node by calling annotation.AddAnnotationTo(node) or node.WithAdditionalAnnotations(annotation). Keep in mind that the node is still immutable, so you need to replace the original one with the annotated one in the tree.

Then, after you perform some modifications to the tree, you can get the annotated node back by using something like parentNode.GetAnnotatedNodesAndTokens(annotation).Single().AsNode(). (You can also get all nodes annotated by a specific derived type of annotation by parentNode.GetAnnotatedNodesAndTokens(typeof(CustomAnnotationType)).)

5373,S3-compatible Object Storage systems,"Has anyone come across a near 100% Amazon S3 RESTful API compatible object storage system?

What I am after is a layer that sit on top of any (preferably a POSIX) filesystem that provides Amazon S3 style RESTful API to store (PUT), retrieve (GET), stat (HEAD) and delete (DELETE), with decent authentication.

Commercial projects/ideas are welcome too.

NOTE:

I have so far tried Eucalyptus and Cumulus; of which Eucalyptus seems to be blindly calling itself S3-compatible. The response XML documents are not at all compatible, and is patchy in certain places with no XML documents at all. Cumulus has managed to keep the response documents quite similar, but seems to have forgotten about data integrity!

Let me explain the latter part: both Eucalyptus and Cumulus have no support for integrity verification that Amazon S3 offers. What you can do with S3 is that you can provide a Base64(MD5(FILE)) along with the PUT request, which then gets verified by S3 before they respond with a success. Eucalyptus and Cumulus doesn't support this. With, Eucalyptus we can at least get around this by checking the MD5 given in the response document (not S3-compatible behaviour). In Cumulus, this is not possible as it doesnt respond with anything (like S3). It is made even worse by Cumulus, by not giving out an ETag in the HEAD request.

5417,Prevent Cell Overlap in Excel using VBA,"I am wondering if there is a way to prevent a cell's text from overlapping into the adjacent cell(s) without having to resize the cell itself, or set the cell contents to wrap.
",Ehudz,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1373525,"The only way aside from the two methods you've mentioned (re-sizing the cell and setting it to wrap) is to have text in the adjacent cell. [edit: There's one other method I forgot, as Siddharth Rout pointed out, if you format cells as ""Shrink to fit"" (under alignment>text control), the font size will automatically shrink such that the content fits inside the cell width.] If you just want long text to get cut off at the cell's edge, Excel will do this only if the cell the text would otherwise flow into has content of its own.

The fastest way to enforce this automatically would be to:


Loop over all cells with content.
Place a blank space in the horizontally adjacent cells if they do not already have content.


Note that you should either do this to both cells to the left and right of cells with overflowing content, or check whether the text is left aligned or right aligned to help decide which of the two horizontally adjacent cells will need to be filled.

If you ONLY want to do this for cells that would have otherwise overflowed, then you have to do something more complicated. You will have to:


Loop over all cells with content.
Check if the cell adjacent to the current one is blank. If not, you can skip this cell and move on to the next one.
Copy the content of the current cell to cell in a blank column (preferably on a new temporary sheet).
Tell your temporary column to auto-size (to find out the desired width of the cell).
If the auto-size width of the temporary column is larger than the source column's width, then the cell content is going to overflow - so you need to place a blank space in the adjacent cell.

$$ f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3} f(x) + \frac{2}{3} f(y)\right)&lt;g^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3} g(x) + \frac{2}{3} g(y)\right)$$

for all $0\le x &lt; y \le 1$?



This question, related to generalized means (characterized by Kolmogorov-Nagumo and de Finetti), arises from the fact that such system has a [infinitely many] solution in the case that the sign of the inequalities are the same, e.g. $(f(t),g(t))=(t^\alpha,t^\beta)$ for some $\alpha \neq \beta$. What happens if the signs are reversed?
",Paolo Leonetti,https://mathoverflow.net/users/32898,"No. Denote $f(x)=a$, $f(y)=b$, then $g(f^{-1}(t))=h(t)$. Applying $g$ to both parts of first inequality we get $h(\frac13 a+\frac23 b)&lt;\frac13 h(a)+\frac23h(b)$. It means that $h$ is convex (proof below), analogously the second inequality means that $h$ is concave.

Lemma. If $h$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and $h(tx+(1-t)y)&lt;th(x)+(1-t)h(y)$ for fixed $t\in (0,1)$ and all $x&lt;y$, then $h$ is convex.

Proof. Consider the set $S$ of $s\in [0,1]$ such that $h(sx+(1-s)y)\leq s\cdot h(x)+(1-s)\cdot h(y)$ for $x\leq y$. It is clearly closed since $h$ is continuous. Assume that $S\ne [0,1]$, then the complement $[0,1]\setminus S$ is open, take any (maximal by inclusion) interval $(\alpha,\beta)\subset [0,1]\setminus S$, $\alpha\in S,\beta\in S$. We easily get $t\alpha+(1-t)\beta\in S$, a contradiction.

5660,How to determine perfect pan temperature for steak?,"I have an electric stove that makes it hard to adjust temperature rapidly. I normally cook steaks in cast iron pan which I put on the biggest stove circle, with the highest setting of 12. I noticed steaks get really burned if I cook it there, but everyone says it should be the highest possible temperature. I even put it on half (6) and got some good results.

Is there a general advice how to determine the pan temperature and how to know what's right for the steak?

UPDATE:

I cooked 1.2 inch, T-bone steak last time on 5.8. It was on room temp for 1 hour. 3 minutes each side. Nearly perfect. I still got a bit too much char on the outside, it was medium-well on the edge of the steak, and medium-rare/rare at the bone. It was delicious though, very soft and juicy.

Doe this sound about right?
",Ska,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/15020,"I don't think there is any single answer to this question, because it would depend on:


The type and thickness of the steak
The starting temperature of the steak
How well you like it done (because the goal is to get enough browning and crust development on the outside, without crossing over into burning, while still cooking the steak through)
The peculiarities of your own equipment, including both your element and your pan (a thick heat retaining pan will have less temperature drop than a thin one, and so require less ongoing source of heat)


Even if we could give you a single answer, it would probably be in terms of the surface temperature of the pan before you put a steak into it, and unless you have an infrared thermometer (which have only become reasonably available in the last 10 years or so, and are not typical kitchen equipment), that answer would not be actionable to you.

So we fall back on less precise methods, saying things like the oil should just be smoking, or that it should be shimmering, or that a bread cube should brown in about 5 seconds. 

Perhaps the best test also requires the most experience to apply.  Hold your hand, open, palm down, over the surface of the pan about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the surface for a few seconds.  The length of time it takes for it to become uncomfortable tells you hot how the pan is.   It should be about 3-4 seconds, but again, requires experience to use this method, and everyone's perception varies.

In any case, you are going to have to employ trial and error as you learn the idiosncracies of your own burner, and your own taste in steak.

That said, there are a couple of methods that are more forgiving.  Possibly the best is cooking sous-vide, and only searing for browning afterwards in the pan, but not everyone has the equipment and wherewithal of that method.

A technique that anyone can do is to put the steak in a slow oven (about 250 F 120 C) until it is cooked through about 5 degrees F (2-3 C) below the doneness you like, as tested with an instant read thermometer.  IT will be wan and pale looking but this is okay.  You then sear it in a quite hot pan, until it is brown and delicious.  This should only take a couple of minutes, since the steak is cooked through; you are just developing the crust.  This shorter time should be much less likely to burn.



Note:  within limits, a thicker steak requires a lower temperature, but this is very limited.

Thick steaks truly require a two-stage cooking method, such as the ones outlined above, or traditional pan roasting (searing in the frying pan, then transferring to the oven).

In the end, though you will always have to come back to experience with your equipment, and your preferences on how you do your steaks.

5783,"Is force a ""real thing"", or a tool for explaining changes in measurable phenomena?","My physics text says that force is ""an interaction between two bodies or a body and its environment.""  

When an object undergoes acceleration we explain it with a force.  But we don't measure force, we measure the change in acceleration. Is force just a helpful construct to be a placeholder in the equation F = ma?  

Is force defined as the quantity mass times acceleration, or is it really ""an interaction""?   
",user37464,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/37464,"Here is my opinion. In my view Newtonian dynamics works as follows. 

Working within an inertial reference frame, interactions are described by forces, that have to be thought of as functions ot time and position and velocity of the point of matter on which they are applied: $$\vec{F}=\vec{F}(t, \vec{x}, \vec{v}) \qquad (1)$$ 
Above, $\vec{x}$ denotes the position of the point of matter and $\vec{v}$ is its velocity. Every interaction has its own functional form that distinguishes this from other interactions.

In case the interaction is completely due to another similar point of matter with position $\vec y$ and velocity $\vec u$, the functional form of the force acting on $\vec x$ has to include these parameters and the dependence form $t$ does not appear (time homogeneity in inertial reference frames)

$$\vec{F}=\vec{F}(\vec{x}, \vec{v}, \vec{y}, \vec{u})\qquad (2)$$ 

and the third Newton's law must hold, concerning the couple of forces $\vec F$ and $\vec F'$ acting on $\vec y$:

$$\vec{F}(\vec{x}, \vec{v}, \vec{y}, \vec{u})= -\vec{F}'(\vec{y}, \vec{u}, \vec{x}, \vec{v})\:.\qquad (3)$$

In (1) the appearance of $t$ in the functional formula of $\vec F$ represents  an external system imposing that force on the point at $\vec x$. It is assumed that the evolution of that system is given. Forces due to strength fields are of the said type: Think, in particular,  of forces due to known fields ${\vec E}(t,\vec{x})$ and ${\vec B}(t,\vec{x})$ ($^{*}$).

One of the major tasks of '700-'800 physics was finding out the functional form of forces associated to the known different interactions. Gravitational force, Coulomb force, Lorentz force were discovered and described  in accordance to this paradigm.

Why the mathematical structure  (1) is relevant in physics?

This is because, if the function $\vec{F}$ is sufficiently smooth, the 2nd law of dynamics, intepreted as a differential equation:   

$$\frac{d^2\vec x}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{m}\vec{F}\left(t, \vec{x}, \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}\right) \qquad (4)$$

admits a unique solution for given initial data $\vec{x}(0)$, $\frac{d\vec x}{dt}|_{t=0}$, as established by a celebrated theorem due to various mathematicians ($^{\dagger}$). That is nothing but the mathematical representation of the mechanical determinism.  

I would like to stress that, for systems of many points, 


(a) assuming (3) for each couple of forces 


as well as 


(b) supposing the validity of superposition principle of different forces acting on a point of mass, 


one ends up with a system of differential equations with the same property of (4): Existence ad uniqueness of its solutions are always guaranteed for given initial data.

Regarding the notion of mass, i.e. the constant $m$ associated with the point of matter in (4), it is worth stressing that it does not depend on the type of interaction, namely, on the particular functional form of the force $\vec{F}$ acting on the point. In this sense the mass is a property of the point of matter.

The approach I have (so quickly) illustrated does not work, as is  well known, due to various reasons (all modern physics, essentially, arises from that failure). There is, however, in classical physics a class of very familiar interactions that cannot be completely encompassed within that paradigm. These are reactive forces due to geometric constraints. We know that they are of electrical nature, however their functional form is practically unknown and it is replaced by some geometrical information about the constraint.

Think of a point constrained to belong to a given curve and also subjected to a force of known functional form $\vec{F}$. The reaction $\vec \phi$ acting on the matter point, due to the constraint,  is an unknown of the dynamical problem:
 $$m\frac{d^2\vec x}{dt^2} = \vec{\phi}+ \vec{F}\left(t, \vec{x}, \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}\right) \qquad (5)$$

The Lagrangian approach to mechanics represents, in my opinion, one of the most powerful attempt to deal with these situations, for a certain class of forces due to constraints (including smooth constrains, but also forces due to the rigidity constraint and other physically relevant cases).   

Obviously one of the most relevant and devastating problems with Newtonian paradigm was the failure of the third principle (3) in the presence of electromagnetic forces with moving charges in dynamical regime.     

So referring to your questions:

(Q1) Is force just a helpful construct to be a placeholder in the equation $F = ma$?

(A1) No. It is instead a much more sophisticated theoretical  notion, because it is a function of the kinematic status of the system and every interaction has its own particular functional form. 

(Q2) Is force defined as the quantity mass times acceleration, or is it really ""an interaction""?

(A2) It is not defined as the quantity mass times acceleration. $F=ma$ is a (differential) equation  where, barring a few (but physically relevant) cases $F$ is known while the motion is unknown. Furthermore the term $F$ showing up in $F=ma$ is the sum of all forces acting on the matter point due to all interactions. Also for this reason $F=ma$ cannot be considered  the definition of $F$. Each single force appearing in the RHS of $F=ma$ is the mathematical description of a corresponding interaction.



Added comments in particular after some remarks by Idear


In the absence of forces, the motion of a point of matter is, in a sense, the natural one: constant velocity (possibly vanishing velocity) in every inertial reference frame. In this view, forces can be seen as the causes of deviations from the natural motion.  Acceleration is therefore viewed here as the effect of forces.  
The functional form of $\vec{F}$, in principle, could include derivatives of higher order, as $\frac{d^3\vec{x}}{dt^3}$. It actually happens for some physical systems, like the model of a charged particle taking the EM radiation self-acceleration into account. These functional forms, though possible in principle, generally violate the requirement of a differential equation in normal form:
$$\frac{d^n\vec{x}}{dt^n}= G(t, \mbox{derivatives of order $&lt; n$})\qquad (6)$$
In this case, in general, there is not an existence and uniqueness theorem for the solutions of the said differential equation with natural initial conditions: $\vec{x}(0),\ldots, \frac{d^{n-1}\vec{x}}{dt^{n-1}}|_{t=0}$. Physically speaking determinism could fail. (The heuristic procedure outlined in the footnote($^{\dagger}$)  cannot be implemented, in general, if the form (6) of the differential equation is not valid.)
Do the notion of force encompass all (macroscopic) interactions? That is a very difficult issue for several reasons, in particular for the following one. Suppose to describe physics within a fixed inertial reference frame. Consider a set of $N$ point of matter very far from each other and from the other bodies in the Universe. We know that no force acts on them and their motion has constant velocity. In particular, the relative velocity of one of them is constant with respect to any other point  of the set. This is a very particular situation. How  is it possible? What is the interaction acting on all those points constraining them to move with a so peculiar (relative) motion? This interaction cannot be described in terms of forces by definition. This interaction is just the one which defines inertial frames. As is well known this problem was tackled by Mach and gave rise to the so called Mach's principle that, in turn, played  a crucial role in developing General Relativity by A. Einstein.




Footnotes

($^{*}$) Homogeneity of space, isotropy of space and invariance under Galileian transformations valid for inertial reference frames,  impose further severe constrains on the functional form of (2). 
For instance only the difference $\vec{x}-\vec{y}$ and $\vec{v}-\vec{u}$ are allowed to show up in the explicit expression of $\vec{F}(\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{v}, \vec{u})$. 

($^{\dagger}$) It is sufficient that $\vec F$ is continuous in all variables jointly and is locally Lipschitz in the variable $(\vec{x}, \vec{v})$. $C^1$ jointly in all variables is largely enough. However there is a nice  heuristic argument (I think due to Newton) suggesting the existence of a solution for given initial conditions. Inserting  initial data in the RHS of (4), the LHS produces $\frac{d^2\vec x}{dt^2}|_{t=0}$. The procedure can be iterated ad libitum, since the functional form of $\vec{F}$ is known so that one can compute all derivatives in $t$ of the RHS of (4), obtaining this way all derivatives $\frac{d^n\vec x}{dt^n}|_{t=0}$, for $n=0,1,2,3,\ldots$. These coeffcients give rise to the (formal) Taylor expansion of a (hopefully analytic)  solution of the differential equation.

The tram routes through Manchester city centre are for trams (obviously), but it seems public transport can use the tramways as well.  My understanding is that is legal for cyclists to use bus lanes, so does the same apply to the tram routes?  

I also seen people cycling on the tramways, but are they actually allowed to do so?  Just because people are doing it doesn't make it legal after all, as plenty of people cycle on the pavements as well (which in Manchester is a special kind of stupidity given how busy the streets are!)

",murphy,https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/29370,"For a wide variety of applications, the cost of doing a scalar product is rarely linear in the complexity of the multiplicands. Furthermore, the complexity of a product is usually larger than the complexity of the inputs. This can range from the simple case of multiplying two $n$-bit integers to get a $2n$-bit sum, to the horrible case of multiplying two sparse polynomials with $n$ terms each and getting a polynomial with $n^2$ terms.

The product of two matrices, of course, involves doing lots of scalar products, and correspondingly the product matrix has entries of greater complexity than the inputs. In your example, the scalar sums involved in taking a matrix product are increasing the complexity of your matrix entries too.

Since the costs aren't linear, the cost of chained multiplications can vary wildly depending on the order. A simple method that often gets nearly optimal performance is to try and balance the products: e.g. by always multiplying the two least complex terms of the list.

Grouping terms as you've done achieves this. Doing the products in order, however, is pretty much the worst case scenario.



Addendum: the sparse polynomial example maybe wasn't such a good choice, because in the typical case, the cost of computing the product is linear in the complexity of the output. But I think the main idea is still relevant in this case because you're doing the additions too.

Also, in the case of sparse polynomials, usually the game is to try and maintain the sparseness as long as possible, before products have so many terms they have to be considered dense. Generally there isn't much you can do to maintain sparsity, but what little you can do in a generic way amounts again to balanced products.

http://imgur.com/4VW66IV,rZm8pB5,4hhwJEc (There are 3 images)
",topher,https://photo.stackexchange.com/users/22379,"The tools you need are a camera with a lens, and panostitching software that can create a 360x180 panorama in equirectangular (2x1) format (Hugin is a good open source application).

Tools you'll probably also want are a tripod and panohead to rotate the lens around its no-parallax point to reduce possible stitching errors.  The smaller the space you're shooting in, the easier it is to get parallax that will interfere with a clean stitch, because objects will have moved relative to each other between member shots.

The number of photos you need to take depends upon the camera and lens you're using. Each image can only cover a specific amount of the scene, and to make an equirectangular, you need to cover the entire sphere, so even with an ultrawide zoom, you're liable to be shooting multiple rows of images, as well as a zenith (straight up) and nadir (straight down) shot.  Most people who shoot these kinds of panos prefer fisheye lenses, because of the larger coverage.  A lens with a 180-degree HFoV can cover the scene in four shots (theoretically two, but there would be no overlap for stitching).  A fisheye lens with a 135 degree HFoV (like the micro four-thirds Samyang 7.5 fisheye or Sigma/Nikon 10mm-ish fisheyes) would require six shots around and a zenith and nadir.  An ultrawide like a 10-20 rectilinear lens would typically require two to three rows of 5-8 images, and a zenith and nadir.

The best free package for stitching these types of panos is, as I mentioned above, Hugin. Commercially, there are quite a few other packages, but PTGui tends to get mentioned the most.  Using these packages, well, each has its own tutorials on the website, but the basic steps are typically loading the files, aligning them (where the package software determines control points on the member images that correspond to the same places in the scene), optimization/alignment using the control points, and then output of the final stitch.

This is a rather involved task and it has a steep learning curve. Don't expect to learn it all in a day.

5914,Find the initial volume of the weak acid given a titration graph,"Question

Below is a picture of a titration between a weak acid, $\ce{HA}$, and a 0.150 M $\ce{NaOH}$ solution. Find the initial volume of the weak acid in millilitres in this titration. 




My work so far

From the graph, I think that the two most important points are (0,3.0) and (20.00,8.0) - I don't know the reason, but it looks important.  
At (0,3.0), there is no $\ce{NaOH}$. This equilibrium takes place: 
$$ \ce{HA_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} &lt;=&gt; A_{(aq)}- + H3O+_{(aq)} } $$

The constant $K_\text{a}$ can be found from:
$$
 K_\text{a} = \frac{[ \ce{H_3O^+}][\ce{A^-}]}{[\ce{HA}]}
$$
with $[\ce{H_3O^+}] = 10^{-3}$ since $\text{pH}=-\log_{10}[\ce{H_3O^+}]=3$ 
This is a dead end for me. 
At (20.00, 8.0), $[\ce{H_3O^+}] =10^{-8}$, this number has decreased because some $\ce{H_3O+}$ have reacted with the newly dissolved $\ce{OH^-}$, although how much I can't tell. I have reached another dead end
Other facts I do know:


0.150 M of $\ce{NaOH}$ means for every 1 litre of the solution, there will be exactly 0.150 mole of $\ce{NaOH}$.
$\ce{NaOH}$ dissolves completely as a strong base. So, for every 1 mole of $\ce{NaOH}$ there will be 1 mole of $\ce{OH^-}$

",krismath,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/8234,"Outline

There are three main points of interest in the titration graphic, and two you have found yourself. The three points are


The start at $V_\text{titr}=0$
Halfway to the equivalence point at $V_\text{titr}=10~\mathrm{mL}$
The equivalence point at $V_\text{titr} = 20~\mathrm{mL}$


Why is number 2 important? Because that is where we can read out the $\text{p}K_\text{a}$ value of the acid, because at that point $[\ce{HA}] = [\ce{A-}]$.

Now, armed with this information, here is how to proceed:


Find out total amount of acid
Find out total concentration of acid
Calculate the initial volume from the data gathered in steps 1 and 2


1  Total amount of acid

The total amount of acid can be gleaned from information point 3, the equivalence point.

$$ n_\text{eq} = V_\text{titr,eq} \cdot c_\text{titr} = 20~\mathrm{mL} \cdot 0.150~\mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}} = 0.003~\mathrm{mol} $$

2  Total concentration of acid

The total concentration can be calculated from information points 1 and 2. We know the initial concentrations (denoted by subscript $_0$) because of the pH value at the beginning:
$$ [\ce{A-}]_0 = [\ce{H+}]_0 = 10^{-3}$$

Using the equilibrium constant that we got at point two, we can calculate the initial concentration of the associated (un-dissociated) acid species:
$$ [\ce{HA}]_0 = \frac{[\ce{H+}][\ce{A-}]}{K_\text{a}} = \frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{-1} $$

The total initial concentration of all acid is then trivial:
$$ [\ce{A}]_\text{tot,0} = [\ce{HA}]_0 + [\ce{A-}]_0 = 0.101 $$

Note that we here actually calculated the activities and not concentrations. Since we assume an activity coefficient of $\gamma = 1$ because we only consider dissolved species, the concentrations are simply the activity multiplied with the standard concentration:
$$ c(\ce{A})_\text{tot,0} = \gamma \cdot [\ce{A}]_\text{tot,0} \cdot 1~\mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}} = 0.101~\mathrm{mol\,L^{-1}} $$

3  Calculation of the initial volume

The initial volume is now calculated following the simple concentration formula:
$$ c_0 = \frac{n_0}{V_0} \Leftrightarrow V_0 = \frac{n_0}{c_0}$$

Since the amount of acid is constant ($n = n_0\; \mathrm{const}$), we can easily fill in the values:
$$ V_0 = \frac{0.003~\mathrm{mol}}{0.101~\mathrm{mol\, L^{-1}}} \approx 0.0297~\mathrm{L} = 29.7~\mathrm{mL} $$

5998,Can CPU temperature cause the CPU to appear to spike to 100% in Task Manager?,"I've been having a long running issue with my CPU spiking while watching Netflix. After going through all the hardware/ software troubleshooting I can think of it looks like this is issue is related to the temperature of the CPU itself.

It's a Windows 7 machine with minimal software installed running Chrome/Silverlight to watch Netflix.

What Happens - CPU usage sits at 10-30% while watching Netflix. Occasionally the video will stutter, the audio will continue for a few seconds, and then the video will move very quickly and ""catch-up"" to the audio. During this time the CPU usage displayed in Task Manager/ Resource Monitor will jump to 100%, with Chrome being attributed to the increase.

I discovered the more I cool the CPU - i.e. take the lid off the case, put the PC in a cooler location - the less likely this is to happen.

Running HWMonitor it seems that the apparent spiking is more likely to happen the closer the CPU temperature is to 60C - the CPU is a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6400+ 3.2Ghz.

The Problem - is the CPU heating up because it's running at 100%, or is the CPU appearing to run at 100% because it is overheating? The demonstrably effect cooling the CPU has suggests it's the later.

My Question - How would Task Manager react to an overheating CPU? Could the 100% reading be showing CPU throttling (i.e. showing the CPU using 100% of available resource)? Or would CPU throttling result in the Task Manager showing the percent the CPU is throttled to?

For example if CPU throttling to 20% kicked in due to overheating while the CPU is at 30% should the Task Manager show 100% or 20%?
",BaronGrivet,https://superuser.com/users/86228,"Task Manager shows how busy the CPU is. This is unrelated to the ""maximum"" performance of the CPU. So if you are using 80% of the CPU at a normal performance level, and the CPU clocks back to 50% performance (possibly due to temperature, in your case), the Task Manager should show 100%. The processes want 80% of full performance, but they only have half of the full performance, so they will use 100% of what is available. Task Manager will show 100% because the CPU is 100% busy (but at a lower performance level).

So in your example, if CPU throttles back to 20% performance when usage is 30%, Task Manager will show 100%.

6058,Problem calculating an integral over a surface,"I've been trying to solve this for awhile and can't find a way.
Given $ S={(x,y,z) \in R^3 : z = x^2 - y^2 , x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 } $ and $\phi :R^3 \to R $ defined as $\phi (x,y,z)= (4z +8y^2 + 1)^{3/2}$, find $\iint_{S} \phi dS $.

I think I have to use $ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \phi (T(r,\theta)) \left \| T_{\theta} \times T_{r} \right \| dr d\theta $
So I first parametrized S with $x= r \cos \theta $, $y= r \sin \theta $ and $ z = r [2\cos^2 \theta - 1] $. So I had $ T(r,\theta)= (r\cos\theta , r\sin\theta, r[\cos^2\theta - 1]) $.     

If I'm not mistaken I have to use $ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \phi (T(r,\theta) \left \| T_{\theta} \times T_{r} \right \| dr d\theta $.  

Now I need to find $ || T_{r} \times T_{\theta} || = || (r\cos\theta[2\cos^2 \theta-1+2\sin\theta], r\sin\theta, -r) ||$   

Now, as you can imagine that ends up being one messed up thing once you square the first term, and I haven't found anyway to simplify anything, which leaves me with a pretty tough integral to solve.    

This is the integral I got, but Wolfram Alpha couldn't solve it and neither could I.    

$ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} (8 r^2 \sin^2(\theta)+4 r(2 \cos^2(\theta)-1)+1)^{3/2} \sqrt((r \sin(\theta))^2+(2 r \cos^3(\theta)+2 r \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta)-r \cos(\theta))^2+(-r \cos^2(\theta)-r \sin^2(\theta)|^2) dr d\theta $   

I'm guessing I either used a wrong parametrization, or there's another way to solve this not using $ \iint_{S} \phi(T(r,\theta)) \left || T_{r} \times T_{\theta} \right || dS $.   

Any help would be greatly appreciated.   

EDIT: As Didier pointed out, $z = r^2 [2 \cos^2 \theta +1] $. But that doesn't make matters a whole lot simpler since now $ || T_{r} \times T_{\theta} || = || (-4r^2 \cos \theta \sin^2 \theta - 2 r^2 \cos\theta [2\cos^2 \theta +1], -4 r^{2} \cos^{2} \theta \sin \theta + 2r^2 \sin \theta [2\cos^2\theta +1], r) || $.   

EDIT2: Another retarded mistake, fixed by Didier.
$ || T_{r} \times T_{\theta} || = (-4r^2 \cos\theta\sin^2\theta-2r^2 \cos\theta[2\cos^2 \theta -1], 4r^2 \cos^2 \theta \sin\theta-2r^2\sin\theta[2\cos^2\theta-1], r) $, still not totally right though.

I must have another error somewhere but just can't seem to find it.
",Bananas,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/9852,"I believe you're still looking for something to find your mistake with. Now your things aren't looking that bad from here so I guess just giving you the solution will let you see where you're wrong in your numbers crunching.

Let $S = \{ T(r,\theta) = (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta, r^2 (\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta)) \, | \, \theta \in [0,2\pi], r \in [0,1] \}$ be the chosen parametrization of $S$. Therefore

$\phi(T(r,\theta)) = (4(r^2(\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta)) + 8 (r \sin \theta)^2 + 1)^{3/2} $

$ = (4r^2 \cos^2 \theta - 4 r^2 \sin^2 \theta + 8 r^2 \sin^2 \theta + 1)^{3/2} = (4r^2 + 1)^{3/2}$

and

$
T_r \times T_{\theta} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec i &amp; \vec j &amp; \vec k \\
\cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta &amp; 2r(\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta) \\
- r \sin \theta &amp; r \cos \theta  &amp; r^2(-4 \sin \theta \cos \theta)
\end{vmatrix}
$

$
= (-4r^2\sin^2 \theta \cos \theta - 2r^2 \cos^3 \theta  + 2r^2 \sin^2 \theta \cos \theta, 4r^2 \sin \theta \cos^2 \theta - 2r^2 \sin \theta \cos^2 \theta + 2r^2 \sin^3 \theta, r)
$

$
=(-2r^2 \cos \theta, 2 r^2 \sin \theta,r) \quad
$
so that $\quad ||T_r \times T_{\theta}|| = \sqrt{4r^4 + r^2} = r \sqrt{4r^2 + 1}$.
Now it's easy because
$$
\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 (4r^2+1)^{3/2} (r\sqrt{4r^2 +1}) \, dr d\theta = 2\pi \int_0^1 r(4r^2 + 1)^2 \, dr
$$

Even third party apps with root permission don't seem to work, but they hinted that my device uses emulated storage and that it treats both the storage spaces as one.

",Anurag,https://android.stackexchange.com/users/89961,"This does not depend on stock Android, it depends on Xiaomi. Your system is only installed in a partition (system), it does not alterate the whole partition table on your device.

I had the same problem with my MI2S. Only recently I repartitioned the whole phone, giving 10 gigs to the apps' section. It seems like it's the only way. Here are the detailed instructions.

http://xiaomi.eu/community/threads/mi2s-extending-size-of-storage-partition.21391/

Obviously you have to do the opposite, as stillka is removing space from the data partition to give it to the storage one. Giving that you basically have to delete both partitions and recreate them with different size, the procedure is the same, you just have to make your own calculations as you have to give startpoint and endpoint, not size.

I did this procedure twice in a row, because the first time I also removed system1 partition to get another 500 MBs, and I didn't brick my phone nor the first neither the second time so, even if the procedure looks scary it is quite safe. Obviously it means losing every single data you have in your phone, both apps and such and personal data. So, you must use some backup app to save your apps and data and then copy the whole sdcard (including the backup you just did) to your PC, restoring once you recreate the partitions.

Note about chache and system1: you can also delete these partitions (really, shrink them to 3 MB - the minimum to make them ext4 filesystem - as you shouldn't change the original partition table) to gain even more space, but there are consequences.

Cache: some people say this partition is used by Google's Play Store to temporarily store (pardon the play on words) apks files before installing the app to your phone. That means, if you remove it you won't be able to install apps from there anymore, and if you shrink it too much you will be able to instal small apps only. If you use other sources than the Play Store (or, maybe, even Xiaomi's official market) you should be good.

System1: this is for the fake dual boot MIUI uses: every time you update your system through the built-in Updater app, the new ROM is written to the system you were not in, alternating between the two at every update. This is to have a correctly functioning system in your phone, not overwriting the previous system while updating (so, it is like a system backup). If you remove it, you won't be able to use the Updater app anymore, you should every time flash the newer ROM when you want to update. I did not do this as I use MI2S' Sepcial Edition MIUI 6 ROM, and the only easy way to install it without third party tools is install the egular v5 ROM and update with the Updater app. Your choice.

I'm also not sure whether a full-blown BIOS is a requirement, or whether I could cheat my way out of using one (i.e. replace it with an AVR microcontroller or similar).

My end goal is to build something that runs DSL. What I'm aiming for isn't a full extensible board with PCI/ISA slots and USB support, but rather a complete bare-bones board that will run the OS. I'd be going for the absolute minimum requirements - CPU, RAM, basic GPU, IDE controller, PS/2 interface.

Devices may be BGA
few exposed busses

Downsides:

Requires a LOT of devices (e.g. Southbridge, a UART, etc...), all of which are additional ICs. 
Note: the external devices will vary depending on which 386/486 you decide on. The early ones had few integrated peripherals. Later on, many of the peripherals got integrated into the CPU itself.




There are some midpoint-devices, like the 386EX, which is a 386 intended for embedded applications. It's old enough that it's available in TQFP-144 (released in 1994), yet it includes most of the necessary peripherals on-die.

Situation: If you protect your data model from concurrency issues by allowing only one worker thread to have access to it, how would you then differentiate between a Runnable versus a Message in its handleMessage(Message msg) if you were enqueueing both Messages and Runnables in the same message queue?

Q. While my Runnables execute as planned after being posted via handler.postDelayed(myRunnable), I would like to inspect the contents of the Runnable while my worker thread is switching upon it so that I can update my data model appropriately.  

I welcome all feedback and appreciate your time!

Below is the entire contents of 'msg' as shown from Eclipe's debugger.  Is there even enough information here to switch on the Runnable?

msg Message  (id=830030887816)  
    arg1    0   
    arg2    0   
    callback    null    
    data    Bundle  (id=830030968104)   
        mAllowFds   true    
        mClassLoader    BootClassLoader  (id=830023329296)  
            packages    HashMap  (id=830023329320)  
            parent  null    
        mFdsKnown   true    
        mHasFds false   
        mMap    HashMap  (id=830030980304)

    target  IncomingHandler  (id=830031033176)  
    what    0   
    when    180369888   


Below is my worker thread's handleMessage().  Specifically, I instantiated a HandlerThread as my worker thread and bound it's getLooper() to my worker thread Handler.

@Override
public void handleMessage(Message msg) {

    // If this is a Runnable then I need to call my method.
    // This next line is a hack to test for Runnable.
    // I would like to know how to inspect this Runnable
    if (0 == msg.arg2 &amp;&amp; 0 == msg.arg1 &amp;&amp; 0 == msg.what)
        incrementStateMachineBecauseRunnableStarted();

    // Determine which action to take
    // http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5021246/conveniently-map-between-enum-and-int-string
        switch (Cmd.values()[msg.what]) {

        case RECEIVE_NEW_LIST_EMPLOYEES:
            receiveNewListEmployees(msg);
            break;

        case UPDATE_ONE_EMPLOYEE_STATE:
            updateOneEmployeeState(msg);
            break;

        default:
            Log.e(this.getClass().getName(), ""unexpected message."";
            break;
}


This is how I enqueue my Runnable (I run this code on my worker thread, so it is sending a message to itself, to be processed later in handleMessage(Message msg)):

            // Create a new Runnable for this employee
            PostUpdate update = new PostUpdate(employee);
            // Post this Runnable with a sort delay
            postDelayed(update, WAIT_BEFORE_PUSH_MS);


... and this is how I enqueue my Messages (from another thread):

                Message msg = mHandler.obtainMessage();
                msg.what = Cmd.RECEIVE_NEW_LIST_EMPLOYEES.ordinal();
                msg.arg1 = 77;  // deliberately inserting debug value
                Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
                bundle.putParcelableArrayList(Cmd.RECEIVE_NEW_LIST_EMPLOYEES.toString(), mEmployees);
                msg.setData(bundle);
                mHandler.sendMessage(msg);


Finally, my Runnable:

private class PostUpdate implements Runnable {

    private final Employee mEmployee;

    public PostUpdate(Employee employee) {
        mEmployee = employee;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Post update through network to MySql server
        mDao.setState(mEmployee);
    }
}

",Razzle Shazl,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2359945,"My conclusion from using the debugger and inspecting the elements is that you cannot determine in handleMessage() whether a message or a runnable is being processed.

I found empirically (through elimination) that all my Runnables had a msg.what == 0 when I set all my messages to have msg.what to be something other than 0.  Use with care!

6280,How can a Shinigami drop its eyeballs?,"So BB was born with the Shinigami eyes because a Shinigami dropped it's eyeballs. But how is this even possible? Did the Shinigami ripped out his eyes and then let them fall down to Earth? I just don't get it. 

Also, if a human touched the eyes of a Shinigami, would he then also get Shinigami eyes?
",DarkYagami,https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/6399,"a Shinigami dropping it's eyeballs is just something Mello thought of 


  It is unknown how he could have possibly been ""born"" with the eyes, though Mello wonders if a Shinigami dropped its eyeballs to Earth (instead of a Death Note)


Source - Character, 3rd Paragraph, 3rd Sentence

and since Beyond Birthday only appeared in Death Note: Another Note which occurs before the manga (L's first encounter with Naomi Misora during the Los Angeles ""BB Serial Murder Case"" mentioned in volume 2 of the manga) i can really only answer this from logical evidence, absent of any official statement and assuming that Mello is correct.

I would suspect but rather than a Shinigami taking it's eyes out on it's own (which are used to allow Shinigami to work out how much life they will gain from taking a life), we can make the assumption that a Shinigami died.

How we know of 2 ways a Shinigami can die


they fail to extend their own life by taking names
they save the life of a human who's death date had arrived


When a Shinigami dies they turn to sand/dust however this isn't instantaneous, 


Rem's Death: Death Note - The Last Name
Gelus Death: Death Note Anime


as we can see from the links above, Rem began to crumble first however Gelus's eye disappeared first

we also know that there is a Portal which allows travel between the Shinigami Realm and earth. i theorize 2 ways that the Shinigami Beyond Birthday got the eyes from died


said Shinigami saved a human which would explain why they were at the portal
said Shinigami was sooo lazy that it waited to the last minute to take a name to add more life and couldn't take a life quick enough before it died


now while we are told that Shinigami are lazy i don't think they are that lazy not to write names (though Ryuk does note this to Light) so i'm going to assume 1)

regardless, the Shinigami's eyes could have dropped out of it's head and rolled out of the portal which could explain why the eyeballs were dropped and not the Death Note (as we see in The Last Name Gelus's Death Note fell to earth however in the anime it didn't).

So then how did Beyond Birthday get the eyeballs? well it was either by coincidence or since Beyond Birthday was at Wammy's House said Shinigami saved Beyond Birthday at birth by saving his mother who may have been pregnant and was about to be murdered.


  Also, if a human touched the eyes of a Shinigami, would he then also get Shinigami eyes?


this i can't answer, i would assume the timeframe is very small because the eyeballs would have turned into sand/dust and Beyond Birthday was just very lucky to have gotten them before hand because if it was a living Shinigami's eyes, well the sight of Light running around with a bag of apples trying to get Ryuk top allow him to poke his eyes, or Misa looking all cute and asking Ryuk if she can doesn't quite match the tone of the series

6285,Copper for cell incubator to prevent contamination,"For some reason the lab seems to have a problem with contamination every so often.  It's virtually impossible to prevent bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. from getting into the incubator every time you open the door.  Our incubator is pretty old, we don't have one of the new fancier versions that's made with pure copper inside, which effectively kills microorganisms. 

Would it be a good idea to buy a copper plate and place it on the shelf, on which we could put our culture flasks?  Or would it disrupt the flow of heat/CO2 too much?  Would it be better to buy copper foil and wrap the shelves in it, then poke holes into it where all the holes are in the shelf?  

We use good cell culturing practices; I don't contamination is happening because people don't know what they're doing.  It just happens over time with enough people working in a cell culture room.  Could copper in the incubator help?  We probably don't have the money to buy a brand new incubator that's made out of copper, so would this be a viable, economic alternative?
",GPI,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3232,"First thing I'd do is replace the HEPA filter. A copper plate/foil may help, and it certainly won't disrupt the flow of heat, as copper is incredibly conductive (that's why they make electrical wires out of it), and poking holes would help with the airflow, but a new filter will probably make the most difference. I've never used a full-copper incubator, and the few serious contaminations I've had to deal with were related to the HEPA filter and poor TC practices.

If you haven't already, I'd institute a good routine cleaning program as well. Change the water bath each week (make sure you're adding fungicide to the water), and wipe down the whole incubator with bleach followed by an alcohol rinse each month. Make sure you clean all the bleach off, as it corrodes metal if left on very long. At the same time, clean and autoclave all of the removable components like shelves, rails, and water pans.

Good luck!

6331,Using clutch and motor brake - good or bad?,"
  Possible Duplicate:
  Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?  




Edit: As mentioned in the comments: Duplicate of Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?

Many people, it seems, use the motor brake to slow down the car, often when they want to bring it to a complete standstill, e. g. in front of a red light. Depress clutch, shift to a lower gear, engage clutches slowly while letting the engine run at idle speed. Others - including me - let go the accelerator, use the (little) breaking effect excerted by the engine, and eventually just depress the clutch and use the brakes to bring the car to a standstill.

Note that I'm not talking about downshifting at the beginning of a long descent, where continuous braking will let the brakes run hot.

The reason given for the clutch maneuver is that this saves the brakes from wear. But it also puts more wear on the clutch, and possibly on the transmission.

Given the price of a new clutch and that of a new set of brake pads, I'd rather have the latter replaced. And compared to how often I have to use the brakes anyway, it can't be all too much that I save.

Is there any firm advice on this question? Assuming a reasonably recent car, of course - maybe this used to be an issue some decades ago.
",doppelfish,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/2659,"The problem is that what you are talking about is not engine braking as such, but clutch braking.

To engine brake without putting undue wear on the clutch, you do the following:


depress the clutch
change to neutral
press the accelerator so the revs will match the gear you are intending to move to
change into the next lower gear
release the clutch


There should be no slipping of the clutch, and the syncromesh should also not need to run, as you should have matched revs appropriately.

The benefits include less likelihood of locking up, consistent braking, longer brake pad life, and because you are in a lower gear, the braking force is greater.

We're trying to migrate some COBOL code from Windows to Linux. The compiler and such are from Micro Focus. Under Windows the code is developed with Micro Focus Net Express. Linux has Micro Focus Server Express as the equivalent. The programs are compiled and linked using ""make"" scripts. 

So much for the background.

The problem is a ""make"" script that doesn't want to compile and link an executable under Linux. The targets look like this:

    if [ -f $B/$@ -a ! -w $B/$@ ] ; then rm -f $B/$@ ; fi
    cp $@ $B


To put this into context, $0="".o"" (i.e. an object file extension). $(LCOB) is the link command. $X="".exe"" (an executable ... just forget about the extension, we'll fix that in due course). All the other stuff relates to paths ==> not relevant to the issue at hand and, yes, they've all been checked and verified.

Ultimately, I am trying to get ""make"" to resolve a target called ""datLoad.o"".

Included is a second ""make"" script containing the following:

COBFLAGS    = -cx # create object file
GNTFLAGS    =   -ug # create .gnt file
SOFLAGS     =   -z # create 
LCOB        = cob
...
.cbl$O:
    $(CCOB) $(COBFLAGS) $*.cbl, $*$O, NUL, NUL
    if [ -f $(LP)/$*$O -a ! -w $(LP)/$*$O ] ; then rm -f $(LP)/$*$O ; fi
    cp $*$O $(LP)


The relevant part is the target which resolves to "".cbl.o:"". Yes, that's the shorthand version and I don't really like it but I did not write this script. I'm assured that it really means *.o:*.cbl and other similar constructs in the script do work correctly.

With a simple ""make"" I get a link error:

&gt; In function `cbi_entry_point': (.data+0x384): undefined reference to
&gt; `datLoad' /tmp/cobwZipkt/%cob0.o: In function `main': (.text+0x28):
&gt; undefined reference to `datLoad' make: *** [datLoad.exe] Error 1


That means datLoad.o was not created. If I do create it explicitly with:

 cob -cx datload


Then ""make"" still gives the same error as above. Weird! However, what I really cannot understand is the response I get from ""make datLoad.o"" when the target does not exist:

make: Nothing to be done for `datLoad.o'.


I assumed (heaven help me) that the target ""datLoad.o"" would try to create the required target file if that file does not already exist. Am I going mad?

Sorry if this seems a bit obscure, I'm not sure how to phrase it better. If anybody has an idea what might be going on, I'd be really grateful...

6346,Segment control with NULL selection,"In our Android application we have a list view of items. The items can be members of two different groups, Group 1 and Group 2, but can also be without group. To filter the list to show the items in a specific group we use a segment control, one segment for showing All, one for Group 1 and one for Group 2.







download bmml source &ndash; Wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups

Now we want to add a third group, Group 3, and the width is becoming a bit stressed. To be honest, the third group will not fit in this structure at all on the smaller screen models.

I am looking for a temporary quick solution for this problem. The idea to include a side bar to specify filtering is already in the pipeline, but it will be some time before we can release a version with this included, and the new group must be visible as soon as possible.

Therefore, I have an idea of adjusting the segment control, enabling a null selection instead of the All filter. That would open up a free space and the new filter group could be included. Problem is though that I'm finding it hard to argument for this solution, mainly because I have not seen it practised elsewhere as I can remember. 
I have thought about having the segment control scrollable, similar to that of the top shortcut bar in the Android notification view, though that sounds like a more expensive solution.

The segment control is in essence an evolved radio button group/tab control, and making it possible to deselect a tab/button is at first thought not a very attractive idea I admit.

I am looking for feedback on this idea, references to similar solutions, or another cheap solution that would fit into this context.

6379,What does blocking refer to in relation to floor joists?,"This question was triggered by the following line in a home inspection:


  Blocking is not installed for I joists above beams in basement.


I have found pictures of blocking at http://www.diychatroom.com/f14/sister-studs-ceiling-easy-question-11349/ (linked from Floor Joist Blocking).  I have also found that cross bracing is an alternative to solid blocking. According to the National Wood Council's Details for Conventional Wood Frame Construction:


  Adequately nailed subflooring will maintain the upper edges of floor joists in proper alignment. Nailing the ends of joists to band joists or headers provides additional joist support that, under normal conditions, eliminates the need for intermediate bridging.


I feel like I understand the term, and what must be done, but my wife understood the inspector to mention load distribution in relation to the supporting steel beam when he commented to her during this portion of the inspection.

Is my understanding of blocking missing something? Does the possibility of compromising the positioning or structural integrity of the steel support beam exist because there is no blocking?
",Joshua Drake,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/4283,"Blocking typically refers to the structure that prevents the joists from twisting, which would be a concern over a load bearing beam. A solid piece of wood, often the same material as the joists themselves, is installed perpendicular to the joists without any gaps (e.g. I joists would use a piece of I joist for blocking). Two 2x4's installed in an X could also be done, and I've seen that with engineered joists, but check with your local building codes to be sure it complies.

I could also see blocking refer to additional vertical members (2x4's) to carry the load from the beam up to another load bearing object above the floor (e.g. a column). The last type of blocking I can think of would be fire blocking to prevent fire from traveling through the ceiling between parts of the home, though it's unlikely you'd see this requirement in a single family structure outside of a garage.

Like Tester101 says, call the inspector and ask for clarification, they should be happy to provide it.

What are the requirements for a Beis Din to declare items ownerless?
Are there any courts nowadays with such powers, and if not, when was the last time there was such a court?
If there are no such courts, does that mean that we can't institute Takanos which will result in a loss of money to one party? For example, as many follow those opinions that there is no such thing as copyright, is it impossible to make a cherem against copying other's music illegaly (not as a chumra, but as a takana)?

There is a dichotomous outcome on the last day. The length of stay may be different for each patient.

I believe that the patient may develop some ""momentum"" which would tend lead to one outcome or the other.

In that case, your best hope lies in being able to specify a model for the time-dependent stuff. For example, if a simple regression relates Day to Blood Value, you could compare the estimated slope parameter to outcome: 2 groups; simple t-test. If you have additional covariates, you could include them as well. You would then have a logistic regression with your slope parameter and covariates in the model. You could fit a more complex functional form if needed. 

You might be able to model the blood value component in other ways: try a principal components analysis, and if most of the variation appear to be on the first component, replace the whole series of observations with the PC score. Then proceed as before with a logistic regression. 

If you had the same number of ""repeated observations"" for each patient, you could try a discriminant analysis. This is similar to the PCA mentioned above, except that the components are chosen to best distinguish between the two dichotomous outcome of the last day. 

Whatever you do, you can estimate your model from one portion of the data set and test it on the other part -- see how well you can actually predict the outcome.

",Mysteriousness,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/31859,"Quite the opposite. MonoGame stands to be the perfect replacement for existing XNA developers. It doesn't do everything that XNA did yet but there's no good reason why it can't. Coupled with the fact that it sports many more platforms and it's already being used in many reputable games I'm confident it will be great for some time to come. 

Edit: I wrote this answer on my phone, let me elaborate a little more.

Firstly, MonoGame does not depend on XNA, it's an open source implementation of the XNA API and does not use Microsoft's implementation in any way. They make it clear in the  Contributing to MonoGame instructions that no code from the XNA framework is actually used in the implementation, only the public API. Therefore, MonoGame exists on it's own without XNA.

Secondly, the MonoGame project is being actively developed. You can see on github there is plenty of commit activity going on. The most recent post on their website was 2 days ago announcing 2 MonoGame titles coming to PS4. 

Third, the MonoGame forums are active. The most recent posts are today, and plenty of discussions going on around development, new game announcements, new platform support and solving problems. They also have other active social feeds like twitter and as Noctrine pointed out an ""official status""

One of them states that the index finger points in the direction of the velocity of a particle, the middle finger points in the direction of the magnetic field, and the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force.

I'm curious why the magnetic field vector is perpendicular to the magnetic force vector.
",Vedaad Shakib,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/45351,"I am still thinking very hard about this problem, but so far I have realized one very peculiar thing. 

The magnetic field tried to make any particle go in a circle in such a way that it makes a magnetic dipole that the existing field can try to push away!

Just imagine a magnetic field into the plane of the paper, and a positive particle going towards right in the plane, the magnetic field exerts an upward force making it go in a circle and thus trying to make a magnetic dipole which would have its own field out of the plane. If such a dipole would be made, the existing magnetic field would try to push it away if it were free and if it were fixed it would reduce the net magnetic flux.

Further thought development; 
If you have a  loop having clockwise current as seen from behind, it would have a magnetic field pointing towardw the other side from which we see, if there is a positively charged particle moving towards the right, it would be forced to move in a circular path in a counterclockwise direction from our point of view.

The existing loop forces/forges another loop which has current going in opposite direction than itself, it is interesting to note that both loops have effectively locked their negative-positive charges in a loop. As current goes clockwise in original loop, its electrons go counterclockwise these along with themselves seem to be taking the positively charged particle along with them for a ride in a circular embrace! 

They are not pulling the particle close to themselves because there is no net electric field outside of the wire, so it still is an enigma why the locking system appears while electric field seems not to be there at all!

I know this does not completely answer the question, but I am still thinking on the subject and after thinking about this, I thought maybe someone else can benefit from this and answer efficiently if I cant!

So you would have

abstract class Person { PersonId, ... }

class Teacher: Person { PrimarySubject, ... }


If you want Students you do

context.Persons.OfType&lt;Student&gt;().Where(....

Has there ever been a different count? What are some Nafka Mina (relevant applications) of the status of these cities?
",Double AA,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759,"The 4 holy cities correspond to the 4 elements.  Earth (Hebron) because of the cave of the patriarchs, Fire(Jeruselem) because of the temple sacrifices, Water(Tiveriah) because of lake Kineret, Air (Zfat) because it is high in the hills and the buildings being painted blue to keep out the evil eye and the spiritual, airy nature of kabalah which sprouted from the city.

There are some who say that they are reflect 4 temperaments of people, based on those elements, and that people are drawn to each city based on their temperament.

I can only assume that this comes from various statements within the Zohar and the Arizal.  However, the status of the four cities as holy only became ""well known"" in the 1600s.  While Zfat as the holy city of air , is mentioned in 1492. (source wikipedia)

The practical application of these 4 holy cities, is that various predictions regarding the Moshiach is made in reference to them, and Jewish people have asked to be buried in these four cities, even if they lived outside of Israel.  More so than any other places in Israel.



Some conjecture on my part.
I imagine that when coming to Israel in 1492, Tzfat was the only established (read protected) city that the exiles from Spain could return home to.  (It's the only walled city in the north that I am aware of, that was not occupied by various armies and outposts) 

Being that the people were Kabalists, and grew great inspiration from the place that they were, they gave it a certain holiness because of their hopes that it would be the beginning of the redemption.

However, knowing that it was not infact a holy city compared to other more important locations. (like nearby Tiveria, or the obvious home of their yearning, Jerusalem) they wanted to create a group of cities which Zfat could be part of.   A group of four cities, each which have a very clear element associated with them would make for good drashot.  And indeed, I have heard some great drashot over the years with this concept in mind.

Alternatviely, it's possible that Kabbalists required that Israel have a representation of each of the four elements within it's borders, and this was the driving force behind them assigning these cities.  The fact that only Zfat on the list has no ""intrinsic"" holiness or meaning,(pre kabbalists moving there in 1492) leads me to the conjecture that I have just stated.

  runs at the Distributor. For more information, see Replication
  Snapshot Agent.


However, the stored procedure sp_startpublication_snapshot is executed at the Publisher on the publication database and is used to start the Snapshot Agent job that generates the initial snapshot for a publication.

When you configured replication and created the publication, you specified the accounts in which the Snapshot Agent will run under at the Distributor and the Publisher.  This account information is saved.  This is covered in Snapshot Agent Security.

Even though you execute sp_startpublication_snapshot from the Publisher, it already has all of the necessary information to connect to the Distributor and start the Snapshot Agent.

6744,"Where should issues with Google Play Services (e.g., fused location provider) be reported?","Google is bundling a number of services, including Location Services, in the Google Play Services application instead of including them in the open-source Android platform.  Main reasons behind this are to support frequent updates of core services without requiring OEMs to update the entire platform, and to hide the implementation of some proprietary services.

The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a good forum for reporting issues with Google Play Services and Location Services (e.g., problems with the new fused location provider).

Here are the current options for reporting Android issues that I'm aware of, and none of them seem like the right place to report a Google Play Services issue:


""Support"" link at bottom of Google Play Services page - Most obvious place to start, but it redirects to the generic Android Developer Support page.
Google Product Forum for Android - This forum seems on-topic for Google Play Services, but was closed as of Sept 3, 2013.
Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) issue tracker - This is where the ""Report a platform bug"" link on the Android Developer Support page points.  This issue tracker is for AOSP, and since Google Play Services is independent of AOSP, issues related to Google Play Services and network Location Services implemented by Google (including the older network provider) are off-topic here.  
android-platform Google Group - Also aimed at AOSP, not Google products.
android-developers Google Group - Description of the group says to post bugs/feature requests to the AOSP issue tracker (#3 above).  Also, it appears most questions related to location/ Google Play Services posted to this group are rarely addressed by the Android team and replies mainly come from other developers.
StackOverflow - There are Google Play Services / location tags here, but there is no indication that any issues are being observed or triaged by Google.
Google Maps API Issue Tracker - Android Maps API v2 - This feature of the issue tracker is specifically for the Android Maps API v2 (which is part of Google Play Services), but not Google Play Service in general and not for Location Services, which are separate from the Maps API v2.

6821,variation in antigen binding site of antibodies,"Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins made ​​by the immune system in response to alien(!) molecules. Each antibody binds to its specific antigen. This great diversity and specificity is cause of diversity in Antigen Binding Site of heavy chain and light chain of antibody. Although other sections of Antibody are highly stable, Binding sites are very mutant. What is the reason for this difference in mutation rates in different parts of antibodies?
",MySky,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/1916,"The processes are called gene rearrangement and somatic hypermutation, and are used by maturing B-cells to generate very (very) large amounts of diversity in the antibody repertoire. If your institution has access, this great article in Annual Reviews in Immunology has all the details, or you can read about it in Janeway (slightly outdated edition). Essentially, the genes encoding the B-cell Receptor, or BCR, have many fragments of several different types in them, and through the process of gene rearrangement the final Complementarity Determining Regions, or CDRs (the antigen-binding sites), are generated into one mature sequence for each individual B-cell.

A mature IgG molecule (the soluble, secreted version of the BCR) contains four chains - 2 heavy (each of which are identical to each other) and 2 light (also identical). There are Constant or C regions in each chain that essentially don't vary much, and are not really involved in the process of antigen binding. On the ""business end"" are three regions (or types, from above) called V, D, and J in the heavy chain, while the light chain just has V and J. Those letters are from Variable, Diversity, and Joining, if you're interested.  

 

Figure 4.3 from Janeway shows the number of ""fragments"" or gene segments of each type in humans. So, when the heavy chain is being made, 1 fragment out of 65 Vs is picked, 1 of 27 Ds, and one of 6 Js, then each is joined together in a process that can also introduce an additional amount of randomness at the joins. Combine this with an only slightly less complex process in the light chain (as there is no D region), and the fact that a single insertion/deletion of a base pair can drastically effect the resulting protein sequence, and you get a protein with a huge number of possible sequences, potentially in the range of 1011.

This process of gene rearrangement typically generates immunoglobulins with relatively low affinity for their antigens. During affinity maturation, a process called somatic hypermutation randomly changes individual base pairs (translated to amino acids) in the CDR in cells that are descendents of, and bear the same base sequence as, the original. Cells expressing antigen receptors that are of higher affinity are then positively selected and clonally expanded by the immune system, allowing your body to tailor its response to an infection or other exposure to what it sees as foreign material.

6832,Reporting and handling asynchronous process errors to a client,"I have a product with two separate applications.  The core of the product lives in the database (oracle) and runs according to a schedule. The other is a client application (currently ASP.NET MVC3) used to manage the database application.  There are three levels of validation going on; client, server-side, and database before the client data is saved to the database.  

However, there are cases where pieces of the data set are currently valid but could become invalid at some point in the future. In these cases rather than abort the entire (lengthy) data input process, we just place the process for the data set on hold until the data either becomes valid, or is updated to a valid value. The error might be something like, ""Hey, you scheduled the copy process of data Foo to location X, and then grant access to user Bob. The Bob user account you originally selected is no longer valid, what would you like to do? 'Cancel the Copy Request' 'Change the User' or 'Wait'"".

Is there a best practice for storing and reporting error conditions (fixable by the user) and exceptions (not fatal and not fixable by the user) back to the client from the database?

For example:
- Database starts process A
- Database selects data set Foo
- During process an error or exception is encountered
- Database stores the error or exception
- Database handles the abort for process A with data set Foo
- Database continues process A with next data set until all data sets are processed
- Database completes process A  

Then some time later:
- User logs in to client application at a later time (after the weekend?)
- User receives notification that an error or exception occurred  

My first thought is some sort of db table storing various fields (event_ time_stamp, process, event, object_type, object_pk, event_code, additional_details, status, last_updated). Then setting up client-side templates (i.e. hard coded with parameters) for each error code and presenting those to the user...but there has to be a better way?

Ideally I am looking for a solution that will allow the client to provide helpful UI options that will aid the user in possibly resolving the errors.  

What solutions have you found to this problem? Would something like NServiceBus or MassTransit work?

There are two different requirements here. The first to store the exceptions, and the second to report (and possibly take action on) them.

Only you know what ""fixing"" the error means within your context and can program for that.  In this case, give the user a webform to update the data and save it.

I used Feedforward neural network and now I can see it isnt exactly right choice for this kind of application (creatures have no memory, etc.)

I would like to try again, start from scratch, and I would like to perform better than before. However, I dont know what neural network architecture to select.

What I need:


Possibility of memory: Should I study more about memory cells, or is using correct NN architecture (like Reccurent NN) enough? What will be main differencies?
Possibility of mutations: I would like to not only mutate weihts in network, but also possibility of adding weights / neurons into ""black box"". I plan to use genetic algorithm, so cross mutations + random mutations.
Easy programming: I plan on not using any assets and to write my NN from ground in order to learn. I would preffer more easy neural networks than others. (While Im writing this, I realize there might not be difference)


What I dont need:


Quick computation: I think that 90% of CPU time will be used on other things of controling my creatures, than on computing NN. (as I am terrible programmer)
Training: I will use genetic algorithm to train, so I dont need typical training methods to train NN. I can use types of NN where training part is very CPU intense, as I will drop this part out.


I am looking at possible types of NN and I think some type of Recurrent network would be suitable, but cant really pick a winner, since I only ever worked with Feedforward type, and I will need to learn about the type you will reccomend before I start writing it. I would like to learn just the one you will suggest instead of learn pros/cons of all, since I think It would set me back for too long.

6964,Override a background style programatically,"I have a series of ToggleButtons that have a style applied to them. I want to be able to change the background colour when a button is checked. Each ToggleButton is assigned to the same Checked event which has the following code.

Instead of setting Background=""#AA000000"" on your Border, set Background=""{TemplateBinding Background}"" - this kind of binding only works within aControlTemplate.  Then, add another setter in your style that setsBackgroundto#AA000000`.  You should then find that your triggers have an effect!

6994,Top and ps not showing the same cpu result,"This is linked to this question.

When I run top I get the following result:



pid 3038 is using 18% cpu, however when running



the result is 5.5%. And this number does not appear to be changing with time (i.e. when running the same command a bit later)...

Is the ps command somehow averaging the cpu usage?
",Theodor,https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/26675,"man ps in NOTES section.

   CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running
   during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and it does not
   conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is
   unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.


And, guess you know, but you can also do:

top -p &lt;PID&gt;




Edit: as to your comment on other answer;


  ""Hmm yeah i Wonder how to get that (the instant CPU percentage) from ps""


Short answer: you can't.

Why is it so?

It is like asking someone to calculate the speed of a car from a picture.

While top is a monitoring tool, ps is a snapshot tool. Think of it like this: At any given moment a process either uses the CPU or not. Thus you have either 0% or 100% load in that exact moment. 

Giving: If ps should give instant CPU usage it would be either 0% or 100%.

top on the other hand keep polling numbers and calculate load over time.

ps could have given current usage – but that would require it to read data multiple times and sleep between each read. It doesn't.

Calculation for ps %cpu

ps calculates CPU usage in the following manner:


uptime  = total time system has been running.
ps_time = process start time measured in seconds from boot.
pu_time = total time process has been using the CPU.

;; Seconds process has been running:
seconds   = uptime - ps_time
;; Usage:
cpu_usage = pu_time * 1000 / seconds

print: cpu_usage / 10 ""."" cpu_usage % 10

Example:

uptime  = 344,545
ps_time = 322,462
pu_time =   3,383

seconds   = 344,545 - 322,462 = 22,083
cpu_usage = 3,383 * 1,000 / 22,083 = 153

print: 153 / 10 ""."" 153 % 10 => 15.3



So the number printed is: time the process has been using the CPU during it's lifetime. As in the example above. It has done so in 15.3% of its lifetime. In 84,7% of the time it has not been bugging on the CPU.

Data retrieval

ps, as well as top, uses data from files stored under /proc/ - or the process information pseudo-file system.

You have some files in root of /proc/ that have various information about the overall state of the system. In addition each process has its own sub folder /proc/&lt;PID&gt;/ where process specific data is stored. So, for example the process from your question had a folder at /proc/3038/.

When ps calculates CPU usage it uses two files:


/proc/uptime      The uptime of the system (seconds), and the amount of time spent in idle process (seconds).
/proc/[PID]/stat  Status information about the process.



From uptime it uses the first value (uptime). 
From [PID]/stat it uses the following:



 #  Name      Description
14  utime     CPU time spent in user code, measured in jiffies
15  stime     CPU time spent in kernel code, measured in jiffies
16  cutime    CPU time spent in user code, including time from children
17  cstime    CPU time spent in kernel code, including time from children 
22  starttime Time when the process started, measured in jiffies


A jiffie is clock tick. So in addition it uses various methods, ie., sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK), to get system's Hertz (number of ticks per second) - ultimately using 100 as a fall-back after exhausting other options.

So if utime is 1234 and Hertz is 100 then:

seconds = utime / Hertz = 1234 / 100 = 12.34


The actual calculation is done by:

total_time = utime + stime

IF include_dead_children
    total_time = total_time + cutime + cstime
ENDIF

seconds = uptime - starttime / Hertz

pcpu = (total_time * 1000 / Hertz) / seconds

print: ""%CPU"" pcpu / 10 ""."" pcpu % 10


Example (Output from a custom Bash script):

$ ./psw2 30894
System information
           uptime : 353,512 seconds
             idle : 0
Process information
              PID : 30894
         filename : plugin-containe
            utime : 421,951 jiffies 4,219 seconds
            stime : 63,334 jiffies 633 seconds
           cutime : 0 jiffies 0 seconds
           cstime : 1 jiffies 0 seconds
        starttime : 32,246,240 jiffies 322,462 seconds

Process run time  : 31,050
Process CPU time  : 485,286 jiffies 4,852 seconds
CPU usage since birth: 15.6%


Calculating ""current"" load with ps

This is a (bit?) shady endeavour but OK. Lets have a go.

One could use times provided by ps and calculate CPU usage from this. When thinking about it it could actually be rather useful, with some limitations.

This could be useful to calculate CPU usage over a longer period. I.e. say you want to monitor the average CPU load of plugin-container in Firefox while doing some Firefox-related task.

By using output from:

$ ps -p  -o cputime,etimes

CODE    HEADER   DESCRIPTION
cputime TIME     cumulative CPU time, ""[DD-]hh:mm:ss"" format.  (alias time).
etime   ELAPSED  elapsed time since the process was started, [DD-]hh:]mm:ss.
etimes  ELAPSED  elapsed time since the process was started, in seconds.


I use etime over etimes in this sample, on calculations, only to be a bit more clear. Also I add %cpu for ""fun"". In i.e. a bash script one would obviously use etimes - or better read from /proc/&lt;PID&gt;/ etc.

Start:
$ ps -p 30894 -o %cpu,cputime,etime,etimes
%CPU     TIME     ELAPSED ELAPSED
 5.9 00:13:55    03:53:56   14036

End:
%CPU     TIME     ELAPSED ELAPSED
 6.2 00:14:45    03:56:07   14167

Calculate times:
            13 * 60 + 55 =    835   (cputime this far)
3 * 3,600 + 53 * 60 + 56 = 14,036   (time running this far)

            14 * 60 + 45 =    885   (cputime at end)
3 * 3,600 + 56 * 60 +  7 = 14,167   (time running at end)

Calculate percent load:
((885 - 835) / (14,167 - 14,036)) * 100 = 38


Process was using the CPU 38% of the time during this period.

Look at the code

7036,Foreign key constrains for Python data structures without using real databases,"I'm looking for a way to manage a set of Python data structures which would nicely fit into a relational schema, but without the overhead of having a real database or parsing SQL. The amount of data can be assumed to be small enough to fit conveniently into memory (say, no structure contains more than a million elements).

Most importantly, I would like to have automatically enforced foreign key constraints. Triggering an assertion failure on foreign key constraint violation would be good enough; it's always a programming error.

Here's a real-world example of what I would like to accomplish. I do have the code to do this, but without automatic foreign key constraint checking it's getting error-prone and a mess of asserts.

(These are data structures for code to analyze the execution trace of a machine code program, for the curious. The logger program outputs each unique (previous_instruction_addr, current_instruction_addr, stack_pointer_change) tuple once.)


instrs: set(int) (addresses of machine instructions seen)
next_instrs: dict(int -> set(int)), a dictionary mapping an instruction (which must be in instrs) to a set of instructions (all of which must be in instrs). Relationally, a subset of instrs×instrs.
stk_changes: dict((int,int) -> set(int)), a dictionary mapping a pair of instructions (where the pair of instructions must be in next_instrs) to a set of changes in the stack pointer register
jumps: set((int,int)), a subset of the next_instrs relation deemed to be a jump (including a function call or a return from a function) from one instruction to another. Actually I currently implement this as two dicts, as I need to be able to make queries both of the form ""where does this instruction jump?"" and ""what instructions jump to this instruction?"".
calls: set((int,int)), a subset of jumps that are function calls.
rets: set((int,int)), a subset of jumps that are returns from function.
basic_blocks: set(int), a subset of instrs; the first addresses of basic blocks (blocks of code where execution only ever starts in the first instruction, i.e. no jumps to the middle, and only ever ends in the last instructions, i.e. no jumps from the middle)
containing_bb: dict(int -> int), the basic block that contains each instruction. A subset of instrs×basic_blocks
functions: set(int), basic blocks deemed to be starts of a function. A subset of basic_blocks.
function_calls_by_bb: dict(int -> int), functions called by a basic block; a subset of basic_blocks×functions


And so on; you get the idea.

What I'm essentially looking for is a way to manage all this structure and automatically enforce all the foreign key constraints; for example, I would like basic_blocks.add(something) to fail with an error if something is not a member of instrs. Similarly, I would like basic_blocks.remove(something) to fail if something is still referred to by function_calls_by_bb. Clearly, writing assertions in add() and remove() methods for all of these structures is needlessly verbose and error-prone compared to, for example, foreign key constraints in an SQL database schema.

I'm currently playing with sqlalchemy with an in-memory sqlite database, which lets me describe the constraints in a nice way, but I'm ideally looking for something much more lightweight that does not involve database engines. (It may be that a database engine is ultimately the proper way to do what I'm doing, but currently I'm evaluating alternatives.)

Alternatively, if you can think of other ways to manage structures such as this, I'd also be interested in hearing about those.

Any help appreciated :)
",Raghavendra,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/6926,"Actually it depends on the instrument.
Some instruments can produce different notes for A# and Bb, others can not.

There are different ways to intonate. On one side you have a just or harmonic intonation which is built on harmonics scale (each tone has a a matemathical relation between the base tone), this makes each tonality have its own intonation; on the other side you have temperate intonation which makes a compromise between frequencies and different keys, dividing the interval octave in equally distance semi-tones, to make possible one instrument to play in different keys, always using the same notes.

Here is a good explanation about this. Alsto worth to read this.

In practical terms, to be able to fine tune a chord (just/harmonic intonation in the guitar or different instruments playing/singing together) you must raise or lower some tones. Often the third in the chord needs adjustment. For example the third in F# chord (A#) should be higher than a Bb. If your instrument can't play it (like a piano) you land on tempered intonation, if you can play it (or bend the tone guitar/harmonica/etc) then you can get a just/harmonic intonated chord.

Wheat Williams posted this very clear table on his answer to another question.
Notice how the third in the chord is higher or lower depending on the intonation model you are using. (the A# in my example of the F# major chord).

So, a raw value of 127 (0x7F) from the sensor would correspond to +85c, and a raw value of -128 (0x80) would correspond to -40c.  Therefore, the spacing between consecutive readings (for example, 0x00 and 0x01) is approximately 0.5c.  I came to this conclusion by taking the temperature range and dividing it by the output range of the sensor: (85 - (-40)) / (127 - (-128)).

But then here's the part where my math gets fuzzy.  If the temperature range remained the same (125c from smallest to largest), but was centered on 0, it would go from -62.5 to +62.5).  But it doesn't.  It goes from -40 to 85c.  Therefore, the temperature range has a positive offset of 22.5c. But since there's approximately 2 codes from the temperature sensor for every degree Celsius, a raw value of 0x00 from the sensor would correspond to 11.25c, correct?

TL;DR version:  I have a temperature sensor that ranges from -40c to +85c, and gives the reading back in 8 bit 2's complement.  In order to get the actual temperature in degrees Celsius, I believe I need to add 11.25 (or just 11 to keep things simple) to the sensor output.  Is this correct? 
",CurtisHx,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/25285,"You're confusing the operating specifications of the chip with the readout format.

Basically, the Electrical characteristics specify the range of temperatures at which the IC is guaranteed to work properly. This is a physical characteristic of the device. As the datasheet says Operating temperature range, e.g. this is the temperature range over which the IC is supposed to work properly. It has no relation to the theoretical range of the register containing the measurement value.

The temperature sensor readout is specified as ""-1 °C/digit"". Therefore, each increment of the temperature output equals one degree C. My guess would be that the value of the temperature readout would probably directly correspond to the actual IC die temperature in degrees C, though you should verify this.

The two specifications are unrelated. It's like a car speedometer. My car's speedometer goes up to ~150 miles/hour. However, it's not intended to actually be driven at those speeds. As such, the readout range (0-150 Mph) significantly exceeds the intended operating conditions (~0 - ~85 Mph), as they're different characteristics.

7114,How to get rid of captcha prompted by Google (while searching)?,"I am a programmer and I Google a lot.

The problem.

The thing is that it seems that Google finds my search requests fishy (often related to security and compile errors, something casual users won't search for) and asks me to enter captchas from time to time.

It all started something about a year ago - I've found myself entering captchas a couple of times a week - not really pleasant, but something one can live with. Sometime about half a year ago the situation got worse - Google asked me to enter captchas up to 5 times a day (!), but after some time it eased a bit and lately I've been entering captchas about once a week. Last week Google started to ask me double captchas (asks one and another immediately. First captcha was entered 100% correct - I triple checked it).

It is true that I sometimes search really weird stuff but captchas keep being asked even for casual queries. Also it happens when I Google on different OSes (Windows/Ubuntu) and in different browsers (Firefox/Chrome), so I suspect that this is something that is relevant to my google profile.

What I tried.


Dug through Google account preferences - found nothing useful.
Saw some articles and tutorials on the internet (like this for example), but all that I stumbled upon was outdated and didn't help me to solve my problem.




So, in the end, what can I do to confirm that I am a human once and for all, or at least reduce amount of captchas that I have to enter while Googling?

There are patches but you need to compile the Qt-libs to use them. Or use non-KDE programs ( Comment #17 From C W J Lemmens  2009-11-20 11:44:47 ):

7201,Finding the MLE for $θ$ given a probability density function $f(y |\theta )$.,"
  Let $Y_1$, $Y_2$, . . . , $Y_n$ denote a random sample from the probability density function
  $$f (y | θ)=\begin{cases} (θ + 1)y^θ, &amp;  0 &lt; y &lt; 1; θ &gt; −1,\\ 0 ,&amp; \text{elsewhere.}\end{cases}$$ 
  Find the MLE  for $θ$.


My approach is first
$$L(\theta) = (\theta+1)^n \biggl(\prod_{i=1}^n y_i\biggr)^{\!\theta}$$
$$\ln L(\theta) = n \ln (\theta+1) + \theta \sum_{i=1}^n  \ln y_i$$

Taking the derivative of it, we got $$\frac{d \ln L(\theta)}{d \theta} = n\frac{1}{\theta+1} + \sum_{i=1}^n \ln y_i$$

Setting it to zero, we got $$\frac{n}{\theta+1} = - \sum_{i=1}^n \ln y_i $$

Then $$\hat{\theta} = \frac{-n}{\sum_{i=1}^n \ln y_i} - 1$$

However, the answer is $$\hat{\theta} = \frac{-n}{\sum_{i=1}^n \ln y_i}$$

I am wondering what part of my answer is wrong. Could someone please help figure it out?
",afsdf dfsaf,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/102647,"Your answer is correct; the provided answer is the MLE of $\theta + 1$, not $\theta$.  You can see this either through simulation, or by direct calculation:  if we let $$s = -\sum_{i=1}^n \log y_i &gt; 0,$$ then $$\hat \theta = -1 + \frac{n}{s},$$ and $$\ell(\hat\theta \mid s) = n \log(\hat \theta + 1) - \hat\theta s = s + n \log \tfrac{n}{s} - n.$$  But $$\ell(\hat \theta + 1 \mid s) = n \log \left(\tfrac{n}{s} + 1\right) - n$$  So their difference is $$d(s,n) = \ell(\hat\theta \mid s) - \ell(\hat\theta + 1 \mid s) = s + n \log \frac{n}{n+s}.$$  It is easy to show that this expression is always positive for $s &gt; 0$ and $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$:  its derivative with respect to $s$ is $\frac{s}{n+s} &gt; 0$, so it is strictly increasing, and $d(0,n) = 0$.

",codecowboy,https://music.stackexchange.com/users/15759,"There are no chords called C1, C2, C3, or C4. In the tab the author just means different versions (voicings) of a C chord; he could as well have called them C_A, C_B, etc. One of those voicings is actually a Cadd9 chord (from low to high):

x 3 2 0 3 3

(the note on the third fret of the b string is a D, i.e. the 9th of C). Note that this chord is different from a C9 chord, the latter being a dominant ninth chord with a minor 7th (a Bb).

There is also no C4 chord, only a Csus4 (suspended fourth), where the third (the E) is replaced by the 4th (the F).

Ed Sheeran actually uses only two types of C chords in that song. The 'standard' open string C chord:

",crm,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/10433,"First, a few points on case statements. The last three cases all do the same thing. To reduce duplication, you can allow cases to fall through:

case """":
case "" "":
default:
    rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + ""index.jsp"");
    rd.forward(request, response);
    break;


Since, you are falling through to the default, you can just omit the other cases completely, and it will still work. After the rest of the review, this will become less relevant, but added here for future reference.



The biggest problem in this method is duplication. Every case statement, and the else clause execute some form of the following:

rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + ""&lt;PageFilename&gt;.jsp"");
rd.forward(request, response);


Over and over and over we see this. Let's do some basic refactoring to clean this up a bit. First, we extract it out of the case statement:

private Set&lt;String&gt; PAGES = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(
    ""about"", ""contact"", ""theory"", ""testimonials""
));
...
if(page != null) {
    switch (page){
    case ""home"":
       testimonialList = testimonialService.getTestimonials(2);
       request.setAttribute(""testimonialList"", testimonialList);
       break;
    case ""about"":
        priceList = priceService.getPrices();
        request.setAttribute(""priceList"", priceList);
        break;
    case ""testimonials"":
        testimonialList = testimonialService.getTestimonials(pageNum, perPage);
        paginationList = testimonialService.getPaginationDetails(pageNum, perPage);

        request.setAttribute(""paginationList"", paginationList);
        request.setAttribute(""testimonialList"", testimonialList);
        request.setAttribute(""perPage"", perPage);
        break;
    }

    String pageFilename = PAGES.contains(page) ? page : ""index"";
    rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + pageFilename + "".jsp"");
    rd.forward(request, response);
} else {
    ...
}


We've extracted out the duplication, created a structure to abstract out picking the file name to use, and remove empty cases. You'll note that I've also removed all the comments. This is not just for brevity; the comments restated what the code did, and were thus superfluous. We can also just get rid of the if(page != null) { ... } else { ... } as there is the same duplication there:

switch (page){
    ...
}

String pageFilename = (page != null &amp;&amp; PAGES.contains(page)) ? page : ""index"";
rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + pageFilename + "".jsp"");
rd.forward(request, response);


It's better, but that ternary statement to get pageFilename is getting a little gnarly, let's extract a helper method:

private String getPageFilename(String page) {
    if(page == null) {
        return ""index.jsp"";
    }

    if(!PAGES.contains(page)) {
        return ""index.jsp"";
    }

    return page + "".jsp"";
}


And our code becomes:

rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + getPageFilename(page));
rd.forward(request, response);


Now let's take a moment to talk about instance variables. You have a bunch of them, and yet they only act as local variables in your method. If this is their whole purpose, we need to just make them local variables. I'm talking about:

private String page;
private int pageNum;
List&lt;Testimonial&gt; testimonialList;
List&lt;Price&gt; priceList;
List&lt;Paginator&gt; paginationList  = new ArrayList&lt;Paginator&gt;();
RequestDispatcher rd;


Unless these serve some other purpose in their lives, we don't need them as instance variables. Ironically, there is one local variable that should be higher in scope:

int perPage = 6;


This should probably be a static final int PER_PAGE = 6 in the class, since it behaves as a class constant.

Here is the code as it stands now:

@WebServlet(""/HomeController"")
public class HomeController extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private static final int PER_PAGE = 6;
    private Set&lt;String&gt; PAGES = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        ""about"", ""contact"", ""theory"", ""testimonials""
    ));

    private TestimonialService testimonialService;
    private PriceService priceService;
    private String views;

    public HomeController(){
        testimonialService  = new TestimonialService();
        priceService        = new PriceService();
        views               = ""/WEB-INF/views/"";
    }

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String page = request.getParameter(""page"");
        int pageNum = (request.getParameter(""pageNum"") == null)? 1 : Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(""pageNum""));

        switch (page){
        case ""home"":
            List&lt;Testimonial&gt; testimonialList = testimonialService.getTestimonials(2);
            request.setAttribute(""testimonialList"", testimonialList);
            break;
        case ""about"":
            List&lt;Price&gt; priceList = priceService.getPrices();
            request.setAttribute(""priceList"", priceList);
            break;
        case ""testimonials"":
            List&lt;Testimonial&gt; testimonialList = testimonialService.getTestimonials(pageNum, PER_PAGE);
            List&lt;Paginator&gt; paginationList = testimonialService.getPaginationDetails(pageNum, PER_PAGE);

            request.setAttribute(""paginationList"", paginationList);
            request.setAttribute(""testimonialList"", testimonialList);
            request.setAttribute(""perPage"", perPage);
            break;
        }

        RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(views + getPageFilename(page));
        rd.forward(request, response);
    }

    private String getPageFilename(String page) {
        if(page == null) {
            return ""index.jsp"";
        }

        if(!PAGES.contains(page)) {
            return ""index.jsp"";
        }

        return page + "".jsp"";
    }
}


I'm going to stop here. The code is shorter, and duplication has been removed. If I were writing this code myself, though, I would keep refactoring. The switch statement would be replaced with strategy objects. The getPageFilename method would be extracted into a separate class, and would use a proper configuration pattern rather than just a HashSet. There might also be one or two more helper methods to pull out. I would also look into injecting the dependencies instantiated in the constructor, though this might not be possible based on the framework being used.

I have two pushbuttons, when I click the first pushbutton the cube rotates to right, the second pushbuttons is used to rotate it to left.

I also have two arrows keys on the keyboard, up and down, and theirs function is the same as the pushbuttons. When I press the up arrow the cube rotate right and so on.

The problem is when I start the application, the arrows instead of controlling the rotate, select the buttons. So I need to know where I can change this options, i.e, turn off navigation action of the arrow keys in pushbuttons.

Projet is made by inheriting QMainWindow.
",Jakub,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1915733,"Be default, QPushButton (like many other subclasses of QWidget) will have a default way of handling keyboard focus. In the case of buttons, arrow keys move the keyboard focus from one button to the next to facilitate navigating through the window and interacting with the widgets without a mouse.

As hank suggested in a comment, you can force the QPushButton to not accept keyboard focus by calling its setFocusPolicy(Qt::NoFocus), but that will only work in the particular case where the push buttons were the only ones in your QMainWindow that could steal focus. If your have other widgets in there (e.g. a QLineEdit), when the focus ends up there, the arrow keys will still not function right because the QLineEdit will grab those keys, and do nothing.

The more flexible way to solve your problem is to either install an event filter on each of your QMainWindow's child widgets, and have that event filter forward the arrow key events to the functions that rotate your cube (while letting everything else pass through to allow any other event to be processed by the appropriate widget).

Another solution would be to have your cube widget grab all keyboard events with QWidget::grabKeyboard(). That would ensure that every keyboard event gets sent to that widget, no matter where the keyboard focus is. When you want to let other widgets receive keyboard events, you will need to call QWidget::releaseKeyboard() to ungrab it.

  A Sun lamp provides light of constant intensity emitted in a single direction. A Sun lamp can be very handy for a uniform clear daylight open-space illumination. In the 3D view, the Sun light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it, plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light.
  
  This direction can be changed by rotating the Sun lamp, like any other object, but because the light is emitted in a constant direction, the location of a Sun lamp does not affect the rendered result (unless you use the “sky &amp; atmosphere” option).


For more control of the shadow you'll need to use another of the available lamp types.

which obviously wouldn't work in your case.  

What you are describing sounds more like a ""Join"" situation.  Have a look at other companies that offer services for a monthly fee (ex: Zipcar, Adobe Creative Cloud).

To answer your question though, there is no standard icon for this, so you should probably include the word 'Subscribe' or 'Join' wherever the button appears if you can, because it's just not something people will recognise if it's just an icon.  If appropriate you could use the shopping cart icon, but this doesn't usually make sense unless you offer multiple products, and may be confusing for something you pay monthly for.  If you happen to include an icon along with the text, and do this consistently, it may be OK to use just that icon in some places.

If this is an important call to action (if it's the way they buy your product, it should be) you need to make sure it's as clear as possible.

7520,How does the Unity3D entity system work?,"I saw the Java Artemis Entity Component System and thought of the entity system in Unity3D.

In Artemis for example you can only add one component type to each entity and the logic is not in the component.

In Unity3D it's completely different.
Can someone explain me how the entity system in unity 3d works?

I mean, is Unity3D a real entity system, or is it something else?
",user2933016,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/39768,"Unity3D works on top of GameObject-Component model. It's so much different than Entity Component Systems. To my experience it's worse because when you want to code some logic it's put into Script Component, instead of Systems. How different is it to OOP model? Unity3D GameObject contains data and logic - same as in OOP, those components aren't reusable (which is one of reasons for not doing OOP). Of course, you can make some bulletproof conventions which will hold you from mixing data and logic but it might be a pretty hard work to do so continously.

Dependencies. When you work in ECS, every System has an Aspect (it's described which components it manages). Thanks to the Aspect your Components are depended by System and not by other Components. I've seen code where few Components were referencing to each other. When order of execution wasn't set properly, then... total mess. When you refactor Component (logic) dependencies it's better to do it in ONE place, like System, instead of few places (Components).

The another great disadvantage of model used in Unity3D is a problem to manage objects of same Aspect (set of components). In my opinion it is best to go ECS way if possible or something more closer to it. To take that approach in Unity3D, look at @Byte56 answer.

One of the guys'
One of the guy's


EDIT:

Never mind, I think I answered my own question. I realized it would probably be related to the object being possessed. E.g.:


""One of the guys' swords""

means ""There are multiple guys. They own multiple swords. I am referring to one of those swords.""

""One of the guy's swords""

means ""There are multiple guys. One of them owns multiple swords. I am referring to one of those swords.""

In one of the guy's swords, the word guy's is possessive singular, and the meaning is straightforward: One sword belonging to the guy.

This continues for all 114 countries listed. I didn't feel the need to place all 114 options here. 

It appears as if the foreach is just counting each result from the curl and posting that in the select. How would I get this to actually echo out the country name rather than just count? 

In raw form the API results just like so: For example, only one country is listed.

7589,Can we activate syntax highlighting for code blocks based on the question's tags?,"I think it is time to revisit the syntax highlighting question. There is a similar request that suggests using HTML comments to activate highlighting for specific posts. I would rather implement something like we have over on SO and U&amp;L where syntax highlighting is activated according to a question's tags.

So, if a question is tagged as bash, any &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks in the answer get bash highlighting. If it is tagged as perl, the questions get Perl syntax highlighting etc.

I agree with the decision to turn off syntax highlighting on SU by default. It was indeed more often a hindrance than a help. Nevertheless, while many, if not most, SU posts do not need and should not have syntax highlighting, there are many that do. For example, many of these:


3,276 questions tagged with bash
1,034 questions tagged with emacs
6,221 questions tagged with batch
1,627 questions tagged with awk


While not all would benefit from syntax highlighting, many would. Since this is already implemented in a tag-dependent manner on U&amp;L I imagine it would be simple to also activate it here. I think that syntax highlighting only for certain tags would improve SU while not affecting the great majority of questions that need no highlighting.

I would also be happy if we could simply allow the HTML comments to prettify code as suggested in the question linked above. Anything that allows me to optionally allow code highlighting, at the very least for my own answers, would be great.

For visual appeal, tapered joints are easier to completely hide with mud. Rather than spreading out the mud over a wide area to minimize the visibility of the joint, you can completely fill the taper for a perfectly smooth transition.

Any comment would greatly be appreciated 
",nima,https://ell.stackexchange.com/users/3751,"A connotation can just be an idea that we associate with another word, phrase or sentence. So for example the phrase bucket and spade will have connotations of beaches, sunshine, childhood, seaside holidays and so forth. If you're writer and you want to talk about a grave-robber stealing a body from a cemetery, you probably won't want to say:


He picked up his bucket and spade ...


There's nothing wrong with the grammar of this sentence, but when you say bucket and spade it might make people think about happy things, not grave, serious and scary ones. It's probably important for your story for people to be a little bit scared, not happy and comfortable. Notice that nobody would think that the grave-robber was at the beach in that sentence. It is just that using that phrase will make people think about beaches for a second.

An implication is something slightly different. If I imply something, I am saying something specific to somebody, without actually using that sentence (this might be an accident. We might not want the listener to have this idea). Usually, an implication is a proposition -  something that can be expressed as a sentence. So for example, if I say:


If you don't do your homework, you won't get any ice cream.


... then I am implying that:


If you do your homework you will get some ice-cream.


But notice that I did not say that. That second sentence is not part of what I said. If I am a mean and horrible person, I may have deliberately tricked you. But I did not lie. The truth may well be that:


If you don't do your homework you won't get any ice-cream and if you do do your homework, you still won't get any ice-cream.


The reason might be for example, that you are not allowed ice-cream because you're allergic to dairy products. Notice that if I say the whole of the last example, the implication is cancelled. We no longer think that the speaker will give any ice-cream to anyone if the homework is done. We can cancel implications easily. It is difficult to cancel connotations. We may still be reminded of something, like holidays, for example, even if the actual word or phrase is being used in a completely different way.

Conclusion

In the normal uses of these words, a connotation is an association that we have with a word, phrase or sentence. It is not necessarily a proposition. It is not usually the kind of idea we can express in a sentence.

In contrast, an implication is usually a proposition. It is an idea we could express as a sentence. Sometimes the listener may want us to understand this proposition. Sometimes it may be accidental. We can cancel implications. It is difficult, if not impossible sometimes, to cancel connotations.

7711,How to trap stack overflow with pthread?,"I have a C++ application that has a lot of threads and most of them are with 32k of stack size. The problem is that sometimes I get a stackoverflow and I want to detect which thread has caused the stackoverflow and write it on the log file, the problem is that I can't trap it.

I read about the SIGSEGV and I was able to trap this signal only without threads. I also tried using pthread_sigmask() and using the libsigsegv but I also failed.

Can anyone show me a small example about trapping the SIGSEGV when a stack overflow happens in a thread?
",Hola Soy Edu Feliz Navidad,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1615183,"Trapping stack overflow for a multi-threaded application is, for the most part, not any different from doing so for a single-threaded application. The main way it might be different is if you're overflowing by a large margin; for the main thread; this will still leave you with an invalid stack pointer and SIGSEGV in most cases, but with small thread stacks, the overflow might put your stack pointer in the middle of another thread's stack, in which case very bad things will happen and there's no hope of forward progress. Another issue you should check, if you're using small stacks, is that you didn't disable guard pages. Using pthread_attr_setstack (this function is deprecated, by the way) will not give you guard pages unless you already set them up yourself. Using pthread_attr_setstacksize (the proper modern interface) should not interfere with guard page allocation, but you may want to increase the guard size (with pthread_attr_setguardsize) if you think your overflows are by a large margin.

With that said, the general procedure for handling stack overflow is to setup a handler for SIGSEGV and set it to run on the alternate stack. This last point is critical! As the stack pointer is invalid at the time the signal is generated, there needs to be an alternate stack for the signal handler itself to run on. While the flag for whether a given signal is handled on an alternate stack is a per-signal attribute (set by sigaction), the actual alternate stack is a per-thread attribute. Every thread must set its own alternate stack using sigaltstack. The space for the alternate stack could be allocated via malloc or mmap, but the easiest way to do it is just making an automatic char array of size around 2-4k in the thread start function, and using that for the alternate stack. Basically, what this amounts to doing is reserving a small range at the bottom of the thread's stack to be used as emergency stack space for the signal handler after the top of the stack overflows.

An oridnance - ""mishpat"" is something that we can logically determine. We intrinsically know that we shouldn't steal, because civilized people understand the protection of other people's property and it is ""immoral"" to steal.

7739,Why does Eliezer change facts in retelling what happened at the well?,"There are 4 times in parshat Chayeii Sarah that the events at the well are related:

The first is 24:14 (English from the chabad website) - what Eliezer prays for


  And it will be, [that] the maiden to whom I will say, 'Lower your
  pitcher and I will drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also
  water your camels,' her have You designated for Your servant, for
  Isaac, and through her may I know that You have performed loving
  kindness with my master.""


The second is what actually happens (17-20)


  And the servant ran toward her, and he said, ""Please let me sip a
  little water from your pitcher."" And she said, ""Drink, my lord."" And
  she hastened and lowered her pitcher to her hand, and she gave him to
  drink. And she finished giving him to drink, and she said, ""I will
  also draw for your camels, until they will have finished drinking.""
  And she hastened, and she emptied her pitcher into the trough, and she
  ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.


The third is during the recap when Eliezer says what he was looking for (24:43-44)


  Behold, I am standing by the water fountain. When a maiden comes out
  to draw [water], I will say to her, 'Please, give me a little water to
  drink from your pitcher.'  And [if] she will say to me, 'You too may
  drink, and I will also draw water for your camels,' she is the woman
  whom the Lord has designated for my master's son.'


And finally when Eliezer says what actually happened (45-46):


  I had not yet finished speaking thus in my heart, and behold, Rebecca
  came out with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down to the
  fountain and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me to drink.'
  And she hastened and lowered her pitcher from upon her, and she said,
  'Drink, and I will also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also
  watered the camels.


In 3 of the versions, the woman is presented as responding to a single request for water as immediately offering the man water and the camels water. However, in the actual event (version 2) she only offered to water the camels after he finished drinking.

This series of events is commented on in the Artscroll as being the better way -- had she offered to water the camels at first, Eliezer might have rushed to drink or reduced how much he drank (the chumash on page 113 references the Or HaChaim). Her not initially offering to water the camels is a positive thing!

Why then would Eliezer not retell the events in version 4 as they actually happened? Why change it to be in line with the 2 prayer-versions of immediate help? Why lie and lie in a way which detracts from the wonderful thing that she did?
",rosends,https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1362,"According to the meforshim, he changed the narrative in order to convince them that matters proceeded ""from Hashem"".

Rav Hirsch says


  The reason for all the little differences can at once be seen to be
  based, either on considerations of politeness, to which we have
  already referred above, or to make it more plausible to his hearers
  whom Eliezer seems to have perfectly understood.


They would not have appreciated what actually happened. Note that he said that he first verified who she was before giving her the presents, rather than the actual truth (which was that he gave her the presents first). He also emphasized that she acted exactly as he had asked Hashem in order to show them that it was part of the miracle. They would not have appreciated her actually going to the work of watering the camels without being ""influenced"" by Hashem to match the request.

In addition, he hinted that if they said no he had other alternatives (right and left meaning other elements of the family - Yishmael and Lot). 

He did not exactly lie (since Yishmael and Lot were not valid possibilities) he just let them make their own assumptions.

One of the meforshim (Rabbi Sorotzkin or Rabbi Munk? - I do not have their chumashim here) points out that they would not have believed him. Lavan (for example) was of the character דבר הרבה ועשה מעט and would not have believed him if he had told the truth and shown that Rivkah was דבר מעט ועשה הרבה In fact, they would have actually looked down on her for acting in that manner.

He had to be careful to make his story believable to superstitious reshaim such as Besuel and Lavan.

I want to be able to pass a flag to say keep all the FIRST Mondays of the months from X date to Y Date.

So essentially, I want to pass in a date and be able to tell if it's the first, second, third, fourth or last Monday (for example) of a given month.

I have already filtered down the months and days and I am currently using DATEPART(DAY, thedate) to check if the day is &lt; 8 then 1 week &lt; 15 2 week etc.... but this is not correct.

So the part I am stuck on is Where IsDateFirstOfMonth(@date)
Where would I start to write the function IsDateFirstOfMonth?
Any help much appreciated
",user2329438,https://stackoverflow.com/users/2329438,"For this kind of problem it's usually much easier to implement a table with the required date information and join on tthat table, and filter using it. I.e. create a table with this info:

CREATE TABLE Dates(
  Date DATE PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,
  PositionInMoth TINYINT,
  LastInMonth BIT)


Then fill up this table using whichever method you want. I think you'll do it much easyly with a simple ad-hoc app, but you can also create it using a T-SQL script.

Then you simply need to join your table with this one, and use the PositionInMoth or LastInMonth columns for filtering. You can also use this as a lookup table to easyly implement the required function.

By the way, don't forget that there are many months which have a fifth instance of a given day, for example, on december 2014 there are 5 Mondays, 5 Tuesdays, and 5 Wednesdays. The number of days with 5 instances in a given motnh is: number of days in the month - 28, for example, in December it's 31-28 = 3. So you can't count on the 4th being the last.

This table really takes up very little space, roughly, 3 bytes for the DATE, 1 byte for the TINYINT, and 1 byte for BIT, so it's 3+1+1 = 5 bytes per day, 1,825 bytes per year, and 178 kb for a whole century. So, even if you needed several centuries to cover all your possible dates, i would still be a very small table. I say roughly because the index structure, the fill factor and some other things will make the table somewhat bigger. Being such an small table means that SQL Server can easyly cache the whole table in memory when executing the queries, so your they will run really fast.

NOTE: you can expand this table to cover other needs like checking if a day is the last in the month, or the last or first working day in a month, by adding new BIT columns

What I want to draw: A node with a dashed loop, with a small node on the loop, and the part of the loop from the big node to the small one undashed.

How far I went:

The trouble with it being, of course, that the (n)--(s) path does not match the curvy path.  The solution of the previous question does not seem to help, as I want to work with a path resulting from a clipping (and I'm not sure to know how).
",Michaël,https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/65,"This is an incomplete answer  or more exactly an answer with some disadvantages.

A macro to calculate the length of a path between two nodes would be interesting.

7869,What is the problem with powering the Mark 42 suit?,"In Iron Man 3, Tony Stark has a problem powering the Mark 42 suit.  There is a key scene where he has a panic attack because the young boy says the suit is not charging.  There is also a scene where he is charging it from a car battery.

I've never understood this, as one of the major plot points of Iron Man 2 was Tony developing a new element for the arc reactor which could safety power his Iron Man suit and electromagnet in his chest without killing him.

Tony has the modified reactor in his chest since you can see the triangular shape through his shirt.  So why is it suddenly a problem powering the suit?
",Scoldog,https://movies.stackexchange.com/users/6512,"Basically the answer is that the newer suits are not powered by the Arc reactor in Tony's chest, but have their own power supply, so that they can fly and fight even if Tony is not in them.

The user Thaddeus has written an excellent and extensive answer on this over at scifi.stackexchange:


  None of the new armors being developed used the internal power supply from Tony's internal arc reactor. All of his more recent suits (the ones he made AFTER New York) ran on their own independent power supplies. Note the fact they flew, used repulsors and fought Extremis soldiers whether Stark was in them or not.
  
  The complex design of the Mark 42 made for some unique properties:
  
  
  Each piece of independent armor had to have its own power supply to utilize the repulsor/anti-grav flight capacity.
  Each piece of armor had to be able to independently and cooperatively know where it needed to be and in what order it needed to arrive to make the suit viable upon receipt. This mean they were all capable of managing their own power resources.
  Each unit is capable of functioning independent of any other pieces (see Tony's unconventional one hand, one foot aerial ballet of destruction) and thus they are likely not able to be easily recharged unless the suit is in one piece.
  The Mark 42 did not seem to be as physically strong as some of the other designs, possibly because of its very modular nature. Since the suit was designed to fit more than Stark, we see Pepper using it quite well, it makes sense to have the suit function without a direct link to the Arc reactor in Tony's chest.
  It also makes sense to allow the suit to be recharged on ordinary electricity in the event Stark is not around (as it proved to be a useful feature). Recharging on ordinary electricity was a feature of the comic version of Iron Man from the very first designs.
  His suits were designed to absorb solar energy constantly, absorb some electromagnetic energy from his enemies or to be powered directly from land-based power supplies. He could even hook his armor to land based power supplies to augment his strength briefly.

You might be able to glue the lifted areas down using a cyanoacrylate type glue. You need to be very careful with these because they will glue your skin to a surface in a second or two. Such a repair would be iffy, and the handle may continue to peel in other areas. If there are small gaps, you could use a marking pen to mask them, but the coating is fairly transparent on metals (on plastics they tend to look more solid).

You could remove the handle, scrape all loose areas, sand with a very fine paper (or emery cloth), wipe with a solvent (such as mineral spirits) and then spray paint with an all surface enamel. There are a few plastics that resist even that type of paint (such as polyethelenes), but would not be likely used on a plumbing fixture.

8032,Execute several times the same php script without timeouts,"Im developing a system which is supposed to show reports by client. These reports need previous calculations to be done before the actual report is shown.

Since the calculation process is sometimes tedious and long, and sometimes the data that the report uses gets refreshed, the user must be able to re-calculate those reports. For those reasons, the script that generates the report is separated from the script that actually shows the report.

In short, I have two scripts, lets say they're called 'generateReport.php' and 'showReport.php'.

When an user clicks on a client to see its report 'showReport.php' checks if the data it needs has been generated already and if it is, it will show the report. 
If the data is not there, it'll forward the brower to 'generateReport.php' and when finished, it will forward the browser to 'showReport.php'

The problem arises when an user clicks on two clients and they both need theyre data generated.

The first clicked client gets to 'generateReport.php' where the user sees a bar which lets him/her know the whole process. While the page where the second client should be generated just stays there, waiting.

If the first client takes too long, the second one apparently times out and just stays there.

I understand that since im hitting the same php ('generateReport.php') on two tabs on the same browser, apache wont process both requests concurrently so, Is there a way to avoid the second (and possibly third, fourth, etc..) window NOT to time out?

Note: 'generateReport.php' and 'showReport.php' have set_time_limit(0); just for testing and it apparently does nothing.

Note2: I have access to php.ini in my hosting environment

Note3: So sorry for the longish/only boring text post

Thanx in advance!

EDIT1:

Thank you Twisty for your reply.


The requests are generated by HTTP GETs by an user clicking anchor tags.
header(""Location: ..."") is used to take the user from generateReport to showReport.
I was refering to browser tabs, yes.

",seed_87,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1102112,"Apache will run your script multiple times; why would it care?

If generating the report takes more than 2 minutes, the browser itself will usually timeout and stop waiting.

The typical trick here is to have the ""generate"" process run in a separate thread, so it can complete in its own time.

I don't have a sense as to why the second user is blocked, but I'd think there's something blocking in your script.

8045,What happens to the rest of my RAM if I limit Windows to a lowered amount?,"I've been experiencing a little bit of system instability, so right now I'm going about limiting my CPU and RAM usage within Windows to see if I can pinpoint anything. I've found how to limit CPU usage in Windows' power options, and it appears as if the old MS config Window has a place where you can limit the allowance of RAM that Windows has access to:


I have 8 GB of RAM installed and I'd like to limit it to 7. My question is, what happens to the excess 1 GB of RAM? Nothing at all? I have a dedicated video card and video RAM, will it affect that at all? Will this effectively guarantee that I never use more than 87.5% of my total RAM in Windows?

Overall, I guess what I'm asking is if this would be any sort of effective strategy to increasing system stability, or would it just make it more complicated? I am using Windows 8.1 (64-bit).
",Craig,https://superuser.com/users/84562,"
  what happens to the excess 1 GB of RAM? Nothing at all? 


Nothing happens to it. It just isn't used. In Task Manager, Windows will show a ""Total"" of 7168 MB in the system, and that's all it will use. 

The unused RAM will still consume some power, as the refresh circuits have no way of knowing that some of the bits don't matter (anyway, it is not possible for bits in a RAM chip to be selectively refreshed).  

Note that if you have just a single module with eight or sixteen chips, this would not result in one or two of the chips being unused. That isn't how RAM modules are organized. 


  I have a dedicated video card and video RAM, will it affect that at all? 


No. Video RAM is not counted in the RAM used by Windows memory management. 


  Will this effectively guarantee that I never use more than 87.5% of my total RAM in Windows?


Not just ""effectively"". It WILL guarantee that. 


  Overall, I guess what I'm asking is if this would be any sort of effective strategy to increasing system stability, or would it just make it more complicated? I am using Windows 8.1 (64-bit).


No, sorry. What is the nature of the instability you're seeing? Exactly what is the system doing, or not doing? Let's start with that. ""Instability"" could mean any of several things: BSODs, persistent application failures or hangs, whole-system hangs, ... what is the system doing? 

If you think you have failing memory, then memtest86+ or the built-in memory test in Windows (Vista and later) should be tried. If you have more than one DIMM or SIMM, the best way to isolate memory errors to one module is to pull them one at a time, if your mobo permits that, and see if the instability persists (but expect the system to slow down, of course). If your motherboard doesn't permit that, or you only have one module, the only way to really know if a problem is due to a failing module is to try replacing it with a known good one.

8070,How can I rewire half switched receptacles?,"In my bedroom the bottom half of all receptacles are controlled by one switch. Is it possible to have just one receptacle with top and bottom hot all the time?

The top half is hot all the time the bottom half is controlled by one switch.  Keep in mind there are six other receptacles in this room that are the same way controlled by the same switch. When I took the receptacle out the right side tab had been removed.  The top right screw had a black wire, the bottom right had a red wire, the top and bottom left screws had separate white wires.  I changed the receptacle out as suggested, I capped off the red wire and I capped off the white wire that was attached to the bottom left screw. I attached the other white wire to the top left screw and attached the black wire to the top right screw. I now have none of the receptacles working at all. What did I do wrong?
",James,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/32806,"Yes. The tab between the upper and lower sections of each of these outlets have been broken off on the hot (black) side of the receptacles. There are separate wires running to the upper and lower sections. One is always hot and one is switched.

On the outlet you want always hot on both sections, first determine whether the upper or lower section is the switched section. After the power is turned off, disconnect the black wire on the switched part of the outlet. Cap that wire with a wirenut (and tape for backup). Disconnect the black wire from the always hot side of the receptacle. Make two short pigtails of black wire (about 3-4"" each), strip both ends of these wires and attach one end of one of these wires to the upper screw and one end of the other wire to the lower screw on the hot side of the receptacle. Twist the other end of these pigtails together, along with the always hot black wire coming into the box.

This is effectively re-establishing the connection that was removed when the tab between the upper an lower sections was removed to make one half switched.

If there is only one white wire going to the receptacle, you don't need to do anything to that wire.  However, if there is a separate white wire going to the switched half of the outlet, the tab on that side may also be broken, and then you would need to treat it the same as the black.  That is, disconnect the switched white, cap it, create pigtails for the white side and attach them as you did with the black side.

Thanks to DoxyLover for pointing out the possible multiple circuit issue.

Supplement

As pointed out by @Johnny in a comment, an even easier solution is to replace the existing receptacle with a new receptacle that has intact tabs connecting the upper and lower sections (receptacles are very cheap) . Again, you would cap the wires connected to the switched half on the old receptacle, but then you only need to connect the black and white wires from the unswitched side to their respective screws on the new receptacle. The intact tabs will deliver power to both sockets on the receptacle.

",meder omuraliev,https://stackoverflow.com/users/145190,"The clear button has been removed.

As for examples, are you more concerned about how to add a DatePicker in general, or how to style it to look just like your example?

You can set an icon trigger by passing the option buttonImage: 'images/calendar.gif' into .datepicker() (wrap it in curly braces).  You can probably get the fully written out date (ie. 'January 5, 2010') using DatePicker's formatDate() utility function or the altField option.

edit:

To update the departure date as the arrival date is changed, you'll have to use an onSelect option when you enable the arrival DatePicker:

$(""#arrival"").datepicker({
    onSelect: function(dateText, inst) {
        // calculate newDate
        $(""#departure"").datepicker(""setDate"", newDate);
    }
});


newDate can be a number of days from now (like +7) or a formatted date string.  I think the best way to figure it out would be to track the original value of the departure date and determine how many days forward or backward the user changed their selection by, then use that number to determine the new arrival date by comparing to the old arrival date.  It's tracking a lot of stuff manually, but I'm not sure of a better way.  (ick)

8271,Adding javascript actions to words in post content,"I would like to have my blog run some JavaScript code when certain particular words are clicked on.

One approach would be to include ""onClick"" handlers in HTML elements within the posts and disable any filtering that would remove them, but that seems rather dangerous.

Another approach would be create a link whose address starts with a ""#"" and have a script watch for a changing address suffix, but that seems rather hokey.

A third approach would be to have a script scan through the DOM tree for a certain tag and bind events to any elements that contain it.
That might work, though it would leave open the question of how to ensure that switching the editor between HTML and WYSIWYG mode won't gobble up any of the essential information from the annotations.

I suspect the right approach is to use shortcodes, but I'm just starting with WordPress and while I know Javascript, I don't know PHP.

I doubt I'm the first person who has tried to bind actions to particular words in a post, so I don't want to re-invent the wheel needlessly.

If I will want to have many words run the same method, but assign a different string parameter value to each (e.g. I might want to attach the parameter ""bird"" to ""robin"", and ""fish"" to ""guppy"", so that clicking ""robin"" would run ClickedWord(""bird"") and clicking ""guppy"" would run ClickedWord(""fish"")) what would be the best approach to facilitate that?
",supercat,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/60015,"Let's assume you have a javascript like this:

function clickedTag( tag ) {
  var d = new Date(); 
  console.log( 'A word with tag ' + tag + 'has been cliked at ' + d.toDateString() );
}


And in your post you have this sentence: 


  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog


And you want that the javascript clickedTag( ""pet"" ); will run when users click the word ""dog"".

Probably the right approach on javascript side is write a single function with help of data attributes, something like:


  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &lt;span class=""click-tag"" data-tag=""pet""&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;


and the javascript:

jQuery(document).on( 'click', 'span.click-tag', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  var tag = jQuery(this).data('tag');
  if ( typeof tag === 'string' &amp;&amp; tag !== '' ) {
    return clickedTag( jQuery(this).data('tag') );
  }
});


So, using a single tiny function you are able to run your javascript function with any word, and the word itself is not related to the parameter passed to function.

So far, so good. However this has nothing to do with WordPress, and yes, adding that tag to post content brings some problems you explained in OP and also manually adding the span code for every word where you need can be hard if you have a lot of posts and a lot of words that needs to be ""tagged"".

But, yes, shortcodes can be a solution.

Just take one of the examples in the add_shortcode docs in Codex and modify it a bit:

function my_first_shortcode( $atts, $word='' ) {
  $atts = shortcode_atts( array ( 'tag' =&gt; '' ), $atts );
  $format = '&lt;span class=""click-tag"" data-tag=""%s""&gt;' . esc_html( $word ) . '&lt;/span&gt;';
  return sprintf( $format, esc_attr( $atts['tag'] ) );
}

add_shortcode( 'clicktag', 'my_first_shortcode' );


Once you have this few lines of PHP in your functions.php or in a plugin file, you will able to use the shortcode 'clicktag' in your posts, e.g. you can write 


  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy [clicktag tag=""pet""]dog[/clicktag]


and the span with the data attribute will wrap the word ""dog"" in your post.

Combine that with the jQuery function posted above and you are done.

Note that the javascript I posted and also your javascript code (the function clickedTag in this example) should be enqueued in the pages using wp_enqueue_script.
A convenient way is to call wp_enqueue_script inside the shortcode callback (my_first_shortcode PHP function, in example above).

Finally, you would probably want to use the class 'click-tag' to style the span, and let users understand they are clickable.

In this Gist you'll find a working, ready-to-install plugin (just download the 2 files and put them in a folder inside your plugin folder) that contains a just a little modified version of code I posted here.

Only thing left to do is write the real javascript code for clickedTag function, but that will not be covered here.

then next to that, a second smaller light with a separate switch to operate that independently, which looks like it is wired to the main first light. But I'm not sure how to attach it.

I understand the 3 red wires all go together, and the three black? 
But where do the 3rd set of black and red go? :(   ...I'm guessing they might be for the second light/switch?

The picture below is of the wires which were attached to the main light, and below that is the connections to the new florescent light.


",Relievo,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/25082,"You need to connect the switched live to the brown wire in the new fitting and the neutral to the blue wire. The neutral will be one of the black wires. The switched live may be red, or it might be a black wire in one for the T&amp;E cables (though it should have red tape or sleeving on it if it is...).

You might need look at the switches to try and figure out which cable is which. A typical arrangement for two-way switching is shown here (I've linked rather than inline-display the image for copyright reasons).

I'd hazard a guess that the two cables with the red and black joined are the feed coming in and going out to the next fitting on the circuit - but don't take my word for that, please check that for yourself.

8350,Is the TCP protocol good enough for real-time multiplayer games?,"Back in the day, TCP connections over dialup/ISDN/slow broadband resulted in choppy, laggy games because a single dropped packet resulted in a resync. That meant a lot of game developers had to implement their own reliability layer on top of UDP, or they used UDP for messages that could be dropped or received out of order, and used a parallel TCP connection for information that must be reliable.

Given the average user has faster network connections now, can a real time game such as an FPS give good performance over a TCP connection?
",kevin42,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/204,"I would say no. Spacial information of game objects need to be as fast as possible, and for that it's better to use UDP, because reliability is not 100% crutial. Even on modern connections, UDP is still slow enough that you have to make some special considerations for interpolation and such. Even just in terms of the amount of data transferred, TCP would add significant overhead to this.

However, TCP is perfectly acceptable for non-realtime things, such as multiplayer negotiation, chat messages, score updates, etc.

So basically you are just checking for each possible capitalization of the phrase. But what if I typed:


LOCAL AREA NETWORK



It would output incorrect, even though it is actually correct. Why don't you convert the input to either lower case or upper case, and just check against that? That would take care of any and all correctly spelled cases. Example:

if q1.lower() == ""local area network"":
    correct()


Or...

if q1.upper() == ""LOCAL AREA NETWORK"":
    correct()


Naming

naming-things is difficult. What's worst is figuring out what names mean when you're the next person having to maintain the code. A few keystrokes when you write the code can save a lot of headaches for the next person. Example, instead of:


q1 = input(""What does LAN stand for?"")



Perhaps:

techQuizQuestion1 = input(""What does LAN stand for?"")


Also, the following variables are problematic because they are not mentioned in the code outside of the declaration, and their names say nothing about them:


a = input()
# ...
b = input()



If they are needed, it's better to give them a meaningful name.

Then in sentence 19, Hashem tells Moshe to tell Aharon to take his staff and stretch his hand out over the ""waters of Egypt"".

It seems that the point is that it does not matter which staff is being used as it is not a matter of a wizard using an object of power (which might be what the Egyptians thought) but Hashem causing the result.

Update:

I see that you also ask about the difference in usage between nachash and tanin.

The meforshim of the mountain miracles (such as Ramban) connect the snake and the tzora'as to the ""loshon Hara"" of Moshe saying ""they won't believe me"". 

The tanin was considered the symbol of Egypt as shown in Yechezkel 29:3 (haftara of Va'Eira). Thus, what was being shown to Par'o and the court was the symbol of Egypt being under the control of Hashem.

If you had well-seasoned cast iron, it would be grayish colour (well, iron).

It's not unsafe in the same sense as eating raw meat is unsafe, but there are some things you should know:


The base metal (under the coating), if it is in fact aluminum, now has a reactive surface. That means you won't be able to cook anything with vinegar, wine, tomatoes, or anything acidic, without further damaging the pan and leaching metal into your food.
Once a non-stick coating gets scratched, if there's any left, it also starts to peel, and once it starts peeling then it's very easy for it to get into your food. According to DuPont, the chemical PTFE is inert as long as it is not heated to extreme temperatures, so you shouldn't get seriously ill if you happen to eat a few flakes of it by accident. Make your own decision.
Your non-stick pan almost certainly isn't going to be non-stick anymore, which means that even though it probably won't harm you, it will be a truly awful cooking surface.

",InvBoudsuM,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/119257,"Yes, $D(T)$ is dense in $\ell^2$, since it contains all finite linear combinations of the $e_n$, which are dense in $\ell^2$ since $\{e_n\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\ell^2$.

Let us turn to $\sigma(T)$. It is still the case that $T e_n = \lambda_n e_n$ for each $n$, so each $\lambda_n$ is an honest-to-goodness eigenvalue of $T$, and hence, $\overline{\{\lambda_n\}} \subseteq \sigma(T)$. On the other hand, observe that for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \{\lambda_n\}$,
$$
 (T - \lambda \operatorname{Id})\left(\sum_n x_n e_n \right) = \sum_n (\lambda_n - \lambda)x_n e_n,
$$
so that $T - \lambda \operatorname{Id}$ is invertible at least on the dense subspace of finite linear combinations of the $e_n$, with inverse
$$
 (T - \lambda \operatorname{Id})^{-1}\left(\sum_n x_n e_n \right) = \sum_n (\lambda_n - \lambda)^{-1}x_n e_n.
$$
Hence, by the result you cite, $(T - \lambda \operatorname{Id})^{-1}$ extends to a bounded operator on $\ell^2$ if and only if
$$
 \left( (\lambda_n - \lambda)^{-1} \right) \in \ell^\infty,
$$
if and only if there exists some $0 &lt; K &lt; +\infty$ such that
$$
 |\lambda_n - \lambda|^{-1} \leq K
$$
which holds, in turn, if and only if there exists some $0 &lt; K &lt; +\infty$ such that
$$
 |\lambda_n - \lambda| \geq K^{-1},

8626,What causes photovoltaic (solar) cells to degrade?,"Photovoltaic panels can have 20 or 25 year underwritten warranties with a guaranteed remaining efficiency of 80 % of the new panel. That means, that photovoltaic panels seem to degrade somehow.


Why do they degrade? What exactly is reducing their efficiency?
How can this process of degrading be slowed down? E.g. if you don’t need your PV panels, is it possible to conserve them by covering them with a black, opaque coverage like tarp? If not, what else?

",erik,https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7306,"
  Why do they degrade? What exactly is reducing their efficiency?


This link outlines several modes of solar panel degradation, and this report by the National Renewable Energy lab is a very detailed review of studies on solar panel degradation worldwide.

To summarize:


Internal resistance of the cell can increase due to infiltration of contaminants (usually water vapor) when the encapsulating material cracks due to long-term UV exposure or temperature cycling.
The shunt resistance (resistance of the path to ground) can decrease when metal ions migrate (diffuse) through the cell. This happens naturally, with the rate depending on temperature and the type of cell. In general, higher temperatures lead to faster diffusion, and amorphous silicon has higher diffusion rates.
The anti-reflective coating can deteriorate. Anti-reflective coatings can be made of lots of different types of materials, but in general, heat, UV exposure, and exposure to contaminants are what cause them to degrade.


These are all degradation mechanisms of the cells themselves - any of the other components of the panel can also degrade. In all cases, the mechanisms are related to thermal stress or mechanical damage due to things like wind or hail, or corrosion from humidity.

Given all of the above, the main causes of solar panel degradation that can be (sort of) controlled by you are:


Temperature
UV exposure
Mechanical damage



  How can this process of degrading be slowed down? E.g. if you don’t need your PV panels, is it possible to conserve them by covering them with a black, opaque coverage like tarp? If not, what else?


Anything you can do to reduce these three factors would help. However, covering a solar panel with an opaque tarp would only reduce UV exposure. The temperature (and cyclical thermal stress) would likely increase.

Unfortunately, both 1 and 2 increase with exposure to sunlight - and exposure to sunlight is the whole point of solar panels. Mechanical damage can be reduced by installing panels in places and orientations that make it unlikely that they will be stressed by winds, or have things hitting them very often.

However, it looks like the only effective option would be to completely enclose the panels in a temperature-controlled low humidity environment when they are not in use. Whether or not the benefit of doing so is worth the cost will depend on the degradation rate and cost of the particular panels.

I know that the idea behind salami is that it can be store for many months at room temperature, but food bought from a modern supermarket usually bears little resemblance to the traditional meat. It's now a week past it's 'use by' date, and when trying a tiny piece earlier to see if it tasted ok, it had a slight sour taste to it, and I dared no go any further. Does this sound like it's not safe to eat, or is it stil ok if I can handle the new flavour?
",Chris Wilson,https://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/2914,"I can't speak specifically to the shelf life of salami, especially considering all of the factors that come into play (source, type, age, storage, etc.), but when dealing with meat in general, you should never eat it if it smells or tastes ""off"".  Smell is really the most reliable means of determining whether or not meat is still good - far more reliable than the use-by date.

It's unusual for meat to smell or taste sour as a result of foodborne bacteria; sourness is more likely to be due to rancidity of the fats, which is of course equally dangerous, albeit in a different way.  Oxidation is very likely if the meat was not properly wrapped and/or stored in an airtight container.

Of course, many people have trouble telling the difference between spoilage due to rancidity and spoilage due to bacteria, and so what you're perceiving as rancid (sour) may really be bacterial spoilage.

Either way, if it tastes off, it's spoiled; don't eat it.

I am actually not to sure what to do from here, the rules are confusing. To square something is simple, you just foil it. It is easy to memorize and execute. Here though I am not sure if I need to do it like multiplication where I take one $(x + 2)$ term and multiply by another or if I need to multiply all $(x + 2)$ terms by it. 

I want to treat it like how I would square it so I just square it and then I am left with the result and the $(x + 2)$ term. This is wrong and I do not know why. I get this

$$(x^2 + 4x + 4)(x + 2)$$

This is wrong and I am not sure why. So not I try the other way, multiplying everything by everything. This leaves me with

$$(x^2 + 4x + 4)(x^2 + 4x + 4)$$

Which is again wrong. I have exhausted all my options and nothing results in a correct answer and I am not sure why.
",user138246,https://math.stackexchange.com/users/138246,"There is a more intuitive way to do this that works like the FOIL method.

Write $(x+2)^3$ as $(x+2)(x+2)(x+2)$.

When we multiply these we look at all the ways we can pick one element from each of the $(x+2)$s, multiply each possibility and add them all up.

What do these look like? Well, from each $(x+2)$ you can pick either an $x$ or a $2$. Since we pick one from each, we will get three things multiplied together.

If we pick an $x$ from each we will get an $x\cdot x\cdot x$ which equals $x^3$. We can only do this one way so we get $x^3$. 

What if we pick an $x$ from only two of the $(x+2)$s? Then we have to pick a $2$ from the third. How many ways are there to do this? Well, we can pick an $x$ from the first two and a number from the third; we can pick an $x$ from the first and the third and a number from the second or we can pick an $x$ from the second and the third and a number from the first. This gives us $3(2x^2)=6x^2$. So far we have $x^3+6x^2$.

What if we pick only one $x$ and a $2$ from the other two? What do we get and how many ways are there to do this? We get $2\cdot 2\cdot x=4x$ and there are three ways to do this because we can pick the $x$ from either of the three. So we get $3(4x)=12x$ which gives us $x^3+6x^2+12x$ all together.

Are there any other possibilities? Yes, we can pick a number from each and there is only one way to do that so we get $2\cdot 2\cdot 2=8$ and finally we arrive at $(x+2)^3=x^3+6x^2+12x+8$.

This approach is easier than it seems if you practice a few and it works for $(x+a)^n$ for any positive n.

No, you cannot drop the subordinating conjunction that here. A subordinating conjunction is necessary to connect the two parts of the sentence. 

Sometimes a subordinating conjunction can be dropped, but not in this case. Usually we omit a subordiating conjunction after a ""reporting verb"" like to tell, learn, discover, feel etc.:


  She had eyes so far apart from each other! I told her (that) they made me feel dizzy. I really felt (that) they made me dizzy. 


Had it been a relative pronoun, you also could've dropped it:


  I felt dizzy looking into those beautiful eyes (that) she had. 


Here, we can omit the relative pronoun that because it serves as the object of the relative clause ""that she had"". 


  She had what? She had [that]. (She is the subject, that is the object)

chat ""scan"", ping once - I want you to scan here.

8846,Is a ceramic heater good to use in an etching process?,"I use Sodium Persulfate as an enchant at a maximum temperature of 50 C. 

My experience with glass heaters is that they break if they are not fully submerged or if they are removed while it is warm which makes me feel that glass is fragile and has tendency to break easily. 

I see that ceramic heaters are cheaper compared to titanium ones. I wonder if the enchant corrodes the ceramic material? Does a ceramic heater break if it is not fully submerged or removed while it is warm? and are they resistant to mechanical shock from a drop or hit?
",Angs,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/26011,"About glass heaters:


You are absolutely right about the common glass envelope heaters, like the ones used as aquarium heaters. They are usually made of soda-lime glass, which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, making it very sensitive (fragile) to sudden changes in temperature. I have also experienced myself how a glass envelope literally ""explodes"" if taken out abruptly out of the water, while still hot.
As an alternative to common glass envelope heaters, you may purchase a heater with borosilicate glass, less subject to thermal stress.


Other alledgelly known as ""unbreakable"" heaters:


If the glass breaks, either because of thermal stress or by accident, why not simply substitye the envelope material?
Metal (titanium) envelope heaters do exist, resisting several degrees of corrosion. For instance, check here.
Plastic envelope heaters also do a good job by being ""harder"" to break than glass and also resistant to some types of corrosion. For instance, check here. The only drawback is that the thermal resistance of the plastic makes the system reach much more slowly to the target temperature, which I don't think is an issue for an etching application (the bath can be pre-heated to the target temperature before actually starting the etching process).


Now, delving specifically into your etchant (Sodium Persulfate),


According to the Chemical Resistance Guide of Burkert, Sodium persulfate in aqueous solution is compatible with the following plastics, among others: PVC and PP.


I will not dare to use directly a ceramic heater without a proper enclosure. Except if you are willing to make it in a DIY fashion. For a professional (even for a hobbyst) application, I will use an appropriate plastic heater. As last resort, if you cannot find a commercial PVC enclosed heater, maybe you can create your own PCV enclosure, for an standard ceramic heater, then adding an external temperature PID controller with the appropriate configuration (trial and error).

8921,Multivariate exponential smoothing and Kalman filter equivalence,"Suppose the time-series $X$ is hidden state Gaussian random walk and we observe $Y = X + e$,  where $e$ is gaussian white noise independent of $X$.

The Kalman estimator of $X$ in this case has a steady state closed form solution and corresponds to an exponential moving average smoother with constant smoothing parameter. The optimal smoothing parameter looks like $\lambda = \frac{p}{1-p}$  where $p$ is a quadratic formula of signal to noise ratio between $e$ and $\Delta{x}$. See formula for closed form (by searching 'kalman solu‌​tion random walk noise').

If we have instead multiple independent observations $Y_1, Y_2,...$, i.e. independent $e_1, e_2,...$ is there a closed form solution for the optimal estimator of $X$?    What would it look like? 

If the $e_1, e_2$ were independent and identically  distributed (same standard deviation), I can imagine the best estimator for $X$ is to simply average the estimators obtained treating the problem as univariate for each $Y$.

If the $e_1,e_2,...$ have different variance, then some $Y$ series should have low weightings in the overall estimator as their signal to noise ratio is poorer. Perhaps the closed form solution is linear with coefficients proportional to each $Y$ signal to noise ratio.

Is there a known closed form solution? Google seems not to be too helpful on this problem.
",Matthew Pollard,https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/21016,"You haven't specified but if the observation noise is independent of the model noise then I think you should first combine the Y estimates with simple observation variance weighted mean as specified here:

I attatched them using a Generic rigid body constraint with empties connecting the cat mesh to the bells. I also have strings connecting the cat to the bells using the Hook modifier, but I have been able to figure that out.

I just can't seem to find a way to make the rigid bodies follow the deformations of the rig.

Also armature constrainted with IK and deforms mesh (""tentacle""). 

Looks like you have to place additional rigid proxy objects for every bone where could be collision with other rigid bodies.

Now let us consruct such an $f$ violating the desired condition. Firstly, we set $f(x)=x+\eps$ for a small $\eps&gt;0$, so that it satisfies $(*)$. Next, we perturb $f$ in a small neighborhood of $x=5$ so that now $f(5)$ is slighly greater than $f(2)+f(3)$, thus violating the desired condition. Surely, now it also violates $(*)$, but this happens only for $x$ being in a small neighborhood of $5/2$, or for $x$ being almost in $(0,5/3)$ (or, recursively from $5/2$, for $x$ around $5/4$ and smaller ones). Thus, now it is easy to perturb $f$ in a neighborhood of $5/2$, and then simply to increase it on, say, $(0,\,1.9)$ so that it becomes, say, $1.1x+\eps$ on $(0,\,1.7)$.

Older, weaker red wine vinegar, which didn't sufficiently acidulate the water to denature the egg white proteins quickly, thus removing their ability to dissolve
Older eggs, with weaker, looser whites that spread more easily in the poaching liquid, and thus dissolve more easily due to greater surface area
Lower heat of the poaching liquid which would also slow the cooking of the white, allowing it more time to potentially dissolve before the proteins are denatured from heat, and thus can no longer do so

I glued FloorMuffler underlayment to concrete using Roberts Engineered Wood Flooring Adhesive. The instructions say ""open time up to 20 minutes"" and ""install hardwood while the glue is still fresh, do not allow it to skin-over"". I do realize that underlayment material is non-porous and installation method may differ from hardwood flooring, but since there were no specific instructions, I proceeded according to the instructions on the can of glue. I probably gave it 10 minutes of open time before I rolled underlayment on top of freshly applied glue. There was a lot of trapped air that caused bubbles. I pierced them and pressed the air out. Next morning I was ready to install the floor, but I noticed the glue under the underlayment is still fresh. It cured around the edges, but it is completely fresh otherwise. What did I do wrong? What are my options now?

Update:
The underlayment was installed on Wednesday. Sunday night I checked, and there are still some pockets of uncured glue. I am worried that the glue might never set at all. Still looking for a solution.


",user443854,https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/14001,"On its website it says 8-10 hours.  However it is not for the application you used it for.  It is for gluing wood to things.  Not for gluing foam/felt/whatever to concrete.  Your underlayment has basically formed a bubble underneath.  The wood glue needs a lot of air to dry - hence wood glue there will usually be a lot of air available.  Now that the outside have dried quicker of course, now the inside is in the trapped little bubble with no chance at getting good air.  It will eventually dry but this depends on the material and how dense/thick the concrete is.  Also you may want to just remove and use the right glue - which will probably last longer - but that is up to you.  This could take 2-5 days to dry and since the glue was made for wood it may not bond right.

",Ashish,https://magento.stackexchange.com/users/13320,"if you need to apply your own filtering in all product collection, then the best way would be listen to the event catalog_product_collection_load_before. This event will called in every product load operation. 

In your module, first you need to setup this event. So add this content inside your module's config.xml

File : app/code/local/Namespace/Modulename/etc/config.xml

&lt;config&gt;
   &lt;frontend&gt;
        &lt;events&gt;
            &lt;catalog_product_collection_load_before&gt;
                &lt;observers&gt;
                    &lt;namespace_modulename&gt;
                        &lt;type&gt;singleton&lt;/type&gt;
                        &lt;class&gt;Namespace_Modulename_Model_Observer&lt;/class&gt;
                        &lt;method&gt;applyCustomFilter&lt;/method&gt;
                    &lt;/namespace_modulename&gt;
                &lt;/observers&gt;
            &lt;/catalog_product_collection_load_before&gt;
        &lt;/events&gt;
    &lt;/frontend&gt;
    &lt;global&gt;
        &lt;models&gt;
            &lt;namespace_modulename&gt;
               &lt;class&gt;Namespace_Modulename_Model&lt;/class&gt;
            &lt;/namespace_modulename&gt;
        &lt;/models&gt;
    &lt;/global&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;


Now define your observer class like this

File : app/code/local/Namespace/Modulename/Model/Oberver.php

&lt;?php
class Namespace_Modulename_Model_Observer
{
     public function applyCustomFilter($observer)
     {
            $collection = $observer-&gt;getEvent()-&gt;getCollection();

            //you got collection above now perform filtering here.
            $collection-&gt;addAttributeToFilter(...);

            return $this;
     }
}


Any filtering that you apply inside applyCustomFilter() will then affect every product collections.

Hope that will help you.

A ClickOnce link might look like this, and trigger a boostrapper EXE that downloads the latest application EXE before starting it up. This seems difficult to do with the 'published application' model, which I think wants to point to a single, existing EXEcutable to run...

9141,Fix Windows 8 bootloader after converting MBR disc to GPT,"I bought a new MoBo, processor, and some 3TB HDDs last week and am currently setting up a clean installation of Windows 8 on the machine.

The MoBo is an Asus RoG Maximus VII Ranger (What?! It was decently-priced. And shiny. o.o) with the on-board Intel Rapid Storage Tech semi-hardware-RAID thingy. I've configured a RAID5 array with three of the 3TB disks (I'm already aware that a three-disk array with large drives isn't ideal, but I plan to rectify that later by expanding the array).

Windows 8 installed successfully on the resulting 5.4TB array (on the third attempt… >:/) using an MBR partitioning table. Once the machine was running and I'd installed all the hardware drivers for networking, etc, on it, I used AOMEI Partition Assistant to convert the disk to use GPT. This succeeded, and upon rebooting the UEFI bootloader throws an error complaining that a required device is missing, which I expected.

I'm currently booted to the Windows 8 Install DVD in order to fix the problem. After loading the IRST RAID driver, I used diskpart to list the volumes on disk 0, which correctly showed the 350MB boot partition created by the installer, and my 5.4TB C:\ partition.

When I run bootrec /scanos, it gives the following output:

Successfully scanned Windows installations.
Total identified Windows installations: 1

9174,Rotating around an object with a given offset,"I'm attempting to create an effect where two projectiles will come out a given entity at a given offset to the player. A quick implementation was this;

sf::Vector2f offset = m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getPosition();

offset.y -= 5;
createProjectile(offset, m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getRotation());
offset.y += 10;
createProjectile(offset, m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getRotation());


This worked perfectly fine if your entity only wanted to fire across the .x axis, but as soon as you rotated the player it broke as the offset was not going off the players current rotation.

I'm tried many implementation of this but none have seemed to work and as I'm shockingly bad at math, I cannot work it out myself.

void Weapon::createProjectile(const sf::Vector2f&amp; position, float angle)
{
        m_owner-&gt;_state-&gt;addEntity(new Projectile(m_owner, position, angle,*m_texture, m_velocity, m_damage));
}

Projectile::Projectile(Entity* emitter, const sf::Vector2f&amp; position, float angle,
    const sf::Texture&amp; image, int speed, int damage) :
    Entity(emitter-&gt;_state, true, entityName::entityBullet, speed)
{
        Load(_state-&gt;getApp()-&gt;gettextureManager().Get(""Content/ball.png""));
    GetSprite().setRotation(angle);

        SetPosition(position.x,position.y);
        GetSprite().setScale(0.4f,0.4);
}


ANSWER:

float rad;
offset = m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getPosition();

rad = math::to_rad(m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getRotation());

offset.x += 5*sin(rad);
offset.y += -5*cos(rad);

createProjectile(offset,m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getRotation());

offset = m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getPosition();

offset.x += -5*sin(rad);
offset.y += 5*cos(rad);

createProjectile(offset,m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getRotation());

",user1725794,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1725794,"The math you need to study up on is trigonometry. It is very useful!

If your character is rotated theta radians from ""straight up"" going clockwise, your top
offset will be:

offset.x += 5*sin(theta);
offset.y += -5*cos(theta);


and the other will be

offset.x += -5*sin(theta);
offset.y += 5*cos(theta);


This is ""circle math"" (trigonometry) the 5 is the offset you speak of, also called the radius of the circle. A quick sanity check when doing this kind of math is to consider what will happen at 0 radians. Some quick facts of sin and cos:

sin(0) = 0
cos(0) = 1
sin'(0) = 1
cos'(0) = 0


(the second ones are derivatives: sin is initially increasing, cos is flat at the start. Check their graphs.) This and a bit more intuition is helpful for writing graphics code - if we consider the case when theta = 0 we get back your original code. One exception: you are getting the second offset relative to the first offset: I'd avoid doing that and instead make two copies of m_owner-&gt;GetSprite().getPosition(); or reset offset after creating the first projectile.

It is blessed with salt using the following formula (although an older formula is available), which also explains the purpose:


  All make the sign of the cross
  
  Priest: May God who has given us a new birth in Christ by water and the Holy Spirit be with you all.
  Response: And with your spirit.
  
  P: By this blessing of water, we recall the sacrament of baptism in which by water and the Holy Spirit we were reborn. Everytime we are sprinkled with this water or we use it in making the sign of the cross upon entering the church and in our prayer at home, we give thanks to God for his gifts beyond human telling and we implore his help so that we may live up to the sacrament which we have received by faith.
  
  Reading from the Gospel according to John (7:37-39)
  
  Prayer of Blessing
  
  P: Let us pray. Lord, holy Father, look upon us who were redeemed though your Son and were reborn at the baptismal font and grant that those who would be sprinkled by this water may be renewed in body and mind and may offer you pure service through Christ our Lord together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.
  
  If salt is added, the priest blesses the salt using the following prayer:
  
  P: Almighty God, we ask you to bless + this salt as once you blessed the salt scattered over the water by the prophet Elisha1. Wherever this salt and water are sprinkled, drive away the power of evil and protect us always by the presence of your Holy Spirit. Grant this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
  
  He adds the salt to the water.
  
  He sprinkles the water over the people as he says:
  
  P: Let this water call to mind our baptism into Christ, who by his death and resurrection has redeemed us. Amen.


Salt is added because salt is a purifying agent against evil2 (as indicated in the prayer) and it may help to stop the water going off.

Would it be possible for the lung to handle with the rest implying that it is organic? Would it slowing absorb it?
",Wandang,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/6050,"When we eat the architecture makes sure most if not all the food ends up in our foodpipe rather than our windpipe. This is aided by a structure called the epiglottis. 

However frequently foods may be inhaled, for example if a drink is sucked through a straw more if it gets into the lungs compared to if we drink it. Occasionally we will inhale a peanut or something else which typically occurs due to abnormal relaxation or muscular problems in the structures involved. This may be due to a neurological disease (e.g. myasthenia gravis) or because simply drinking too much and inhaling peanuts or vomit (aspiration). 

If the inhaled substance is small and lipid soluble e.g. alcohol, it can pass through the alveoli at the end of the lung to the rich blood supply. If it doesn't we rely on macrophages to digest the food. They aren't frequent enough to digest anything substantial. Bacteria however are great at munching this up and increase substantially in number. Typically your lowest airways are sterile but food can interfere with clearance mechanisms and provide a home. The part of the lung blocked (distal to the foreign object) can collapse and frequently does. In the long run this may cause bronchiectasis, where an infection recurrently affects the area due to permanent damage done during the initial event resulting in widened airways and an ongoing inflammatory response. The inflammatory response reveals even more receptors for bacteria to latch on to.

9259,How to find the center of geometry of an object?,"Well it might be a simple question.  Given a set of 2D or 3D points, the question is:

How to find the center of geometry of an object?

According to the following figure, the center of geometry differs from the center of mass if it is calculated in the simplest form i.e., homogenous density of mass. The problem appears, indeed, in the computation of those.
Commonly, one approach is to average X coordinates and Y coordinates separately i.e., find an average position to the given points (here in 2D). This may be used as centroid for the set of points representing an object.
As shown, due to the extra vertex along the bottom edge, for a simple rectangle the resulting centroid is (0.5,0.4) while the correct answer is (0.5,0.5).
Note that the example given is too simple. The problem of interest however is for complex shapes in 2D and objects in 3D for which only coordinates of vertices are available.
BTW, an efficient computational way is of interest.

Update 1:
Just to mention that I have checked some web links such as Wikipedia's however my current problem is that there are group of 2D and 3D points wish to find a point as representative for those. Thus centroid became of interest. The points are given without any topological information. You may consider them as point cloud. The demonstration here provided to make it clear that the commonly known averaging of coordinates (see for example this) may be incorrect as shown in the example. Hope the point is clear now.  

  

Update 2:
Here are some implementations for comparison:


aa    = accepted answer below
chull = convex-hull of points i.e., the golden polygon
cent  = centroid proposed in Wikipedia and discussed in aa as the polygon centroid
centl = centroid of polyline as explained in aa


Visually, centl looks better representative for the geometry given compared to cent. Two others look promising here but usually they are too biased if the dispersion of the points were inhomogeneous as it is a usual case.
And also consider that although convex-hull makes problem reasonably simpler however it may generate too long and too short edges without any symmetrical positioning in the space, that is, awareness is necessary if you do simple averaging (i.e., without weighting) for both cases: entire points (green) or convex-hull polygon vertices (blue).

  

Update 3:
One application could be found in this post.
",Developer,https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/4537,"Every polygon has, at a minimum, four distinct ""centers"":


The barycenter of its vertices.
The barycenter of its edges.
Its barycenter as a polygon.
A GIS-specific ""center"" useful for labeling (usually calculated with undocumented proprietary methods).


(They may accidentally coincide in special cases, but for ""generic"" polygons they are distinct points.)

A ""barycenter"" in general is a ""center of mass.""  The three types differ on where the mass is presumed located: it either is entirely on the vertices, spread uniformly on the edges, or spread uniformly throughout the polygon itself.

Simple methods exist to compute all three barycenters.  One approach relies on the basic fact that the barycenter of the disjoint union of two masses is the total-mass-weighted average of the barycenters.  From this we easily obtain the following:


The barycenter of two (equally weighted) vertices is their average.  This is obtained by averaging their coordinates separately.  Geometrically, it is the midpoint of the line segment joining the two vertices.
Inductively, the barycenter of n (equally weighted) vertices is obtained by averaging their coordinates separately.
The barycenter of a line segment is its midpoint.  (This is clear by symmetry.)
The barycenter of a polyline is obtained by finding the midpoints of each line segment and then forming their weighted average using the segment lengths as weights.

For example, consider the ""L"" shape delineated by the points (0,0), (6,0), (6,12).  There are two segments: one of length 6 with midpoint at ( (0+0)/2, (0+6)/2 ) = (3,0) and another of length 12 with midpoint at ( (6+6)/2, (0+12)/2 ) = (6,6).  Their length-weighted average coordinates are therefore (x,y) with

x = (6*3 + 12*6) / (6+12) = 5,  y = (6*0 + 12*6) / (6+12) = 4.


This differs from the barycenter of the three vertices, which is ( (0+6+6)/3, (0+0+12)/3 ) = (4,4).

(Edit As another example, consider the figure in the question, which although square in shape, is represented as a pentagon determined by the sequence of points (0,0), (1/2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1).  The five sides have lengths 1/2, 1/2, 1, 1, 1 and midpoints (1/4,0), (3/4,0), (1,1/2), (1/2,1), and (0,1/2), respectively.  Their weighted average therefore equals

[(1/2)*(1/4, 0) + (1/2)*(3/4, 0) + (1)*(1, 1/2) + (1)*(1/2, 1) + (1)*(0, 1/2)] / (1/2+1/2+1+1+1)
= (2/4, 2/4) = (0.5, 0.5)


as one would hope, even though the barycenter of the vertices alone (computed as in #2 above) is (0.5, 0.4).)
The barycenter of a polygon can be obtained by triangulation to decompose it into triangles.  The barycenter of a triangle-qua-polygon coincides with the barycenter of its vertices.  The area-weighted average of these barycenters is the polygon's barycenter.  Triangle areas are readily computed in terms of their vertex coordinates (e.g., in terms of the wedge product of two of the sides).  For an illustration of such area calculations, including how to exploit signed (positive or negative) areas, see the section on ""Area"" at my (old) course notes page.

(Edit Consider the polygon depicted in the question for example.  We could triangulate it with triangles ((0,0), (1/2,0), (0,1)) on the left, ((0,1), (1/2,0), (1,1)) in the middle, and ((1,1), (1,0), (1/2,0)) on the right.  Their areas are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4 respectively and their barycenters--obtained by averaging their vertices--are (1/6,1/3), (1/2,2/3), and (5/6,1/3), respectively.  The area-weighted average of these barycenters equals

[(1/4)*(1/6,1/3) + (1/2)*(1/2,2/3) + (1/4)*(5/6,1/3)] / (1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4)
= (12/24, 6/12)
= (0.5, 0.5)


as it should, despite the presence of that fifth vertex along the bottom edge.)


It is evident that each of these methods is efficient: it requires just a single pass over the ""spaghetti"" representation of the polygon, using (fairly little) constant time at each step.  Note that in all cases except the first (of pure vertices), more information than just a list of vertex coordinates is needed: you need to know the topology of the figure as well.  In the ""L"" example, we needed to know that (0,0) was connected to (6,0) and not to (6,12), for instance.

These are all Euclidean concepts.  They can be extended to the sphere (or ellipsoid) in several ways.  A straightforward one views the features as a simplicial complex in three (Euclidean) dimensions, computes the appropriate barycenter, and then projects it outward from the center of the ellipsoid back to the surface.  This requires no new concepts or formulas; you only have to work with a third (z) coordinate in addition to the first two coordinates.  (Areas are still found using lengths of wedge products.)

Another generalization recognizes that the Euclidean metric--the square root of a sum of squares, according to Pythagoras--can be changed to other Lp metrics for p >= 1: you take the pth root of the sum of pth powers.  Finding appropriate ""barycenters"" is no longer so simple, because the beautiful additive properties exploited above (barycenters are weighted averages of barycenters of simpler parts of a figure) no longer hold in general.  Often, iterative approximate numerical solutions have to be obtained.  They might not even be unique.

Additional centers can be defined for various purposes.  Triangles have many different centers that can generalize (somewhat) to polygons: the center of the circumcircle, the center of (some) maximal incircle, the center of a minimum-area bounding ellipse, and others.  Any set can be enclosed in various ""hulls,"" such as the convex hull, and the centers of those hulls obtained.

Note that many of these ""centers"" are not necessarily located within the interior of a polygon.  (Any reasonable center of a convex polygon will lie within its interior, though.)

This variety of approaches and solutions indicates one should be wary of a generic term like ""center of geometry"" or merely ""center"": it could be just about anything.

9350,Efficient implementation of a linear complexity measure of binary sequences,"For a implementation of testing the quality of random number generators I implemented the NIST test suite in Mathematica based on the nice workbook by Ilja Gerhardt.
However I took up the challenge that Ilja was complaining about the efficiency of Mathematica (see provided link). I was able to speed up most of the test considerably by using Mathematica's native functions. However the the most costly test the Linear Complexity Test gives me some trouble. The test itself is straightforward (see NIST documentation), however it uses the Linear Complexity function based on the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.
My current implementation of this algorithm looks like this:

LinearComplexity = Compile[
{{u, _Integer, 1}}, 
Module[{len, b, c, d, p, pinit, tmp, l, m}, len = Length[u]; 
l = 0;
m = 0;
c = b = Join[{1}, Table[0, {len - 1}]];
pinit = Table[0, {len}];
Do[
 d = Mod[
   u[[n]] + 
    Take[c, {2, l + 1}].Reverse[Take[u, {n - l , n - 1 }]], 2];
 If[d == 1,
  tmp = c;
  p = pinit;
  p[[1 + n - m ;; 1 + l + n - m]] = b[[1 ;; l + 1]];
  c  = Mod[c + p, 2];
  If[2*l &lt;= n, l = n - l; m = n; b = tmp;];
  ]
 , {n, 1, len}
 ];
l
]];


which is about 50% faster than the original cody by Ilja (see link to his Notebook for reference).

Just as an example, the code returns the linear complexity of a binary sequence as follows

SeedRandom[29328];
tst = RandomInteger[{0, 1}, 20000];
LinearComplexity[tst] // Timing


returns

{4.882831, 10001}


However for very large binary sequences the code still is rather slow. I'm aware of multiple shortfalls of it, and would need advice how to fix them. First I would like to get rid of the Do-loop which is in any case not a good idea within Mathematica. Furthermore I would like to switch over to SparseArrays since for long random binary sequences this should reduce the size of the datastructure at least by 50% (random binary sequences have about 50% ones and 50% zeros).

One potential implementation of SparseArrays is the following code:

LinearComplexitySparse[seq_List] :=Module[{len, u, b, c, d, p, pinit, tmp, l, m},
len = Length[seq];
u = SparseArray[seq]; 
l = 0;
m = 0;
c = b = SparseArray[{1 -&gt; 1}, len, 0];
pinit = SparseArray[{}, len, 0];
Do[
 d = If[l == 0, Mod[u[[n]], 2], 
   Mod[u[[n]] + 
     Take[c, {2, l + 1}].Reverse[Take[u, { n - l, n - 1  }]], 2]];
 If[d == 1,
  tmp = c;
  p = pinit;
  p[[1 + n - m ;; 1 + l + n - m]] = b[[1 ;; l + 1]];
  c  = Mod[c + p, 2];
  If[2*l &lt;= n, l = n - l; m = n; b = tmp;];
    ];
 , {n, 1, len}
 ];
Return[l];
];


Which is more memory efficient but 2x slower since it is not compiled.

SeedRandom[29328];
tst = RandomInteger[{0, 1}, 20000];
LinearComplexitySparse[tst] // Timing

{8.392854, 10001}


I did not manage to implement compile (see following code)

LinearComplexitySparseCompiled := 
 Compile[{{seq, _Integer, 1}}, 
  Module[{len, u, b, c, d, p, pinit, tmp, l, m},
    len = Length[seq];
    u = SparseArray[seq]; 
    l = 0;
    m = 0;
    c = b = SparseArray[{1 -&gt; 1}, len, 0];
    pinit = SparseArray[{}, len, 0];
    Do[
     d = If[l == 0, Mod[u[[n]], 2], 
       Mod[u[[n]] + 
         Take[c, {2, l + 1}].Reverse[Take[u, { n - l, n - 1  }]], 2]];
     If[d == 1,
      tmp = c;
      p = pinit;
      p[[1 + n - m ;; 1 + l + n - m]] = b[[1 ;; l + 1]];
      c  = Mod[c + p, 2];
      If[2*l &lt;= n, l = n - l; m = n; b = tmp;];
        ];
     , {n, 1, len}
     ];
    Return[l];
    ];
  ]

tst = RandomInteger[{0, 1}, 20000];

Make the checkbox control only as big as the checkbox itself then place static text next to the checkbox control with transparent background. This works but it means users must click the checkbox directly. Also, accelerator keys won't work which is an accessibility no-no. But it does look better.
Use an external UI handler to custom draw all your controls. This is easier with Burn in WiX v3.6+. The wixstdba UI can be customized using an XML ""theme file"". You can get a lot more custom UI than the standard Windows Installer UI supports.

This is a 100+ year old rental building, so I would like to avoid drilling into the brick as much as possible.  There's one existing anchor in the wall at about the right height, so I could use that and drill one more hole (the other existing anchors are filled in with cement).

",user1140067,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1140067,"What you can do is:


Use XMLHTTP to retrieve the source of the page  
Use the MSHTML object model to further automate the page


Example:
An exploration of IE browser methods, part II

What the code on this page does is:


Take advantage of XMLHTTP's speed to retrieve a webpage source faster than automating IE  
Assign the XMLHTTP response to a MSHTML Document object (effectively 'loading' the page inside the DOM), then  
Use traditional OM methods for looping through page objects, clicking buttons and so on.


At the risk of self-aggrandizement, Tim's advice is spot on. The link he provided has several methods you could use (after getting the page using XMLHTTP, of course) for either iterating through the page and clicking the ""Get Estimates"" button, or setting a reference to it directly and calling the HTMLInputElement.Click method.

9478,Styling issue with custom menus and sub menus,"In a previous question I asked (and later worked out) how to style sub menus, I want to expand on that with another question related to styling sub-menus.

I have hit an issue were if the parent is the selected page all child pages pick up the same styling, I believe this is because the current-menu-item class gets added to the parent li.

If a child element is selected only the child is highlighted (which is correct)

Has anyone encountered this before? What is the best way to only have the selected page highlighted and not the child elements of that page?

As requested, here is the CSS that is being called to highlight the child menu.

.current-page a, .current-menu-item a {
    background-color: #EE8833;
}

",Toby,https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/1213,"You can try using the .current-menu-item li a""first-child selector. Here is an example I've used in the past to highlight the current menu item only:

#menu .current-menu-item {
background:white; 
}
#menu .current-menu-item li a:first-child { 
color:white!important;
}
#menu .current-menu-item a { 
color:black !important ;
}


You will need to change the #menu to your id or class.

",Conor Pender,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/6121,"Yes, you can reassign the returned agents; you do so immediately before continuing with the Waterdeep Harbour phase. But no, you cannot place them in the Harbour. From the FAQ:


  Q: If I complete the ""Recruit Lieutenant"" quest as a result of reassigning an agent from ""Waterdeep Harbor"", do I get to assign that agent immediately?
  
  
    A: Yes. If any effect puts a new agent into your pool during reassignment from ""Waterdeep Harbor"", you assign that agent immediately. However, you can't assign him to ""Waterdeep Harbor"" (he follows the same rule as the ""Research Chronomancy"" quest, a returned/new agent can't be assigned to ""Waterdeep Harbor"" during the reassignment phase of the round).

9597,SQL Server: Time Series Table Design,"I am creating a time series database that follows the table structure here: Storing intervals of time with no overlaps.  The difference with my design is that the FinishedAt column changes every time a user updates that particular record (you can actually see my question on his site at the bottom). 

Basically, I have a FinishedAt column that has the current record with a date of 9999-12-31 until the next record with the same business key gets updated (in his example that key would be the SettingID). I run into the problem with his FK_IntegerSettings_SettingID_PreviousFinishedAt since I cannot make FinishedAt part of my primary key. I cannot make it part of my primary key because it is always changing....but is it okay to make FinishedAt part of my primary key, which would involve updating the primary key? Is this frowned upon even in a time series table?

I realize I can still use his other constraints, but I loose the very important foreign key constraint. This is my first encounter with this type of design so any direction will be appreciated. Thank you.
",Jay Michael,https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/47001,"A foreign key can reference a unique constraint, not necessarily only a primary key, so if you want to be a purist, include FinishedAt (and whatever else you need) in the parent table's unique constraint and use that to define the foreign key.

9623,Is a countered flashback spell exiled?,"If I flashback Past in Flames and it is countered by Cancel, is it exiled or put back into my graveyard?
",BolasStone,https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/9981,"If you counter a spell cast for its Flashback cost from the graveyard, it gets exiled. The rule that covers flashback is 702.33a, and it says


  Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player's graveyard and the other that functions while the card is on the stack. ""Flashback [cost]"" means ""You may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost"" and ""If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."" Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.


Countering a spell normally sends it to the graveyard (or, in some cases, exile, its owner's hand, or their library), but the flashback ability makes it go to exile instead.

It's worth noting that if a counterspell says to exile the spell it's countering (like Spelljack, for example), and then does something with it after it's exiled, that still happens. That's because if the spell is getting exiled anyway, the flashback ability doesn't change anything.
